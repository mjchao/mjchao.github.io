C++ is the primary language I use at my current job in a high-frequency trading firm. I use C++ for anything speed-critical. I have done low-level profiling to squeeze nanoseconds out of high-speed algorithms. I have also designed clean APIs to abstract out dirty details of real-time systems so that other people donâ€™t have to think about them. Overall, I have a strong understanding of C++ and am comfortable using it for most tasks.
