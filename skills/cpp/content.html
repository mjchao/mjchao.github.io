C++ is the primary language I use at my current job. I can write C++ code for most language agnostic tasks, like sending data over sockets and implementation of common algorithms.

<p>
One of my strengths is writing correct and maintainable code. I pay a lot of attention to my style and am never comfortable releasing anything without a suite of regression tests to catch my own errors and errors that someone else after me might make.

I can usually come up with an algorithm of the best theoretical complexity. When making use of C++'s speed, I'm careful not to waste runtime doing things twice. That goes for any language, anyhow. Finally, I try my best to take cache locality into consideration.

Most of my C++ projects have been proprietary for internships and for my current job, so they may not make much sense outside of the company. At Google, one part of my machine learning pipeline was a C++ program for extracting and preprocessing a massive amount of training data (billions of words!). At Jump Trading, I also created a test framework to perform regression testing on some custom order submission software.
