Java was the first programming language I used in school. As a student, I spent hours on end writing programs in Java that were tens of thousands of lines of code. I would mess up the designs, learn from those mistakes, and do better on the next program I wrote. The valuable experience extended to my other programming languages as well.

Iâ€™ve worked with user interfaces, 3D graphics, and TCP/UDP networking. Around the time Java 8 came out, I switched over to C++ due to my college coursework and internships. However, I have confidence that I can get up to speed with a few months of tinkering around. After writing hundreds of thousand of lines of Java code, I still remember the fundamentals of the language very well. It would mostly be familiarizing myself with the newer features.
