    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My fourth programming language in school.</li>
        <li>1 year, ~2 projects totaling ~3000 lines of code.</li>
        <li>Worked with websites and user interfaces.</li>
        <li>Applied JQuery, Ajax, JSON, websockets.</li>
        <li>Combined with HTML, CSS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Javascript is my fifth programming language and the fourth language for which I had formal instruction. I first practiced applying Javascript to creating a chatroom. Afterwards, I created a web application for playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji">Tractor</a>, one of my favorite card games. Recently, I took a course called Web Database Information Systems in which I developed a photo-sharing website through a sequence of programming assignments. Finally, there is, of course, a Javascript component to this personal website I developed.</p>

    <h2>Website Development Experiences</h2>
    <p>I've mostly applied Javascript for developing client-side applications. In the beginning, I wrote my HTML code and performed dynamic changes in pure Javascript by directly accessing and modifying the DOM. I created my chatroom and Tractor web application in this way a few years ago. I learned to use a web socket and communicate with a Java server while implementing my chatroom. I also gained significant experience implementing straightforward algorithms while creating my Tractor web application because there were many rules of the card game that had to be encoded.</p>
    <p>In Fall 2016, I worked on a photo-sharing website in my Web Database Information Systems class. I applied AJAX to query a RESTful API and dynamically update HTML webpages. With formal instruction in school, I improved my code quality and started writing reusable code and applying higher-level libraries such as JQuery. At the same time, I developed this personal website, which applies Javascript and a finite state machine to overlay the content panels.</p>
