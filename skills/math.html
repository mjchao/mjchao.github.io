        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I spend significant time on math when I have the opportunity. When I started high school at Phillips Exeter Academy, I discovered there was a lot of math (including math beyond calculus!), and I realized I was well behind many of my peers. I worked hard on my own time, skipped ahead, and eventually explored abstract mathematics, including algebra. In college, I took advanced courses in combinatorics and probability. I feel comfortable with diving into a topic and also with picking up math on an ad-hoc basis.</p>

        <h2>Standard Coursework</h2>
        <p>I've completed standard college coursework in calculus and linear algebra. I had a strong advantage with my high school background in abstract mathematics, found the college coursework straightforward and obtained A+s.</p>

        <h2>Algebra</h2>
        <p>My first exposure to abstract math was with algebra. I took two courses in high school: one on elliptic curves and a two-person seminar on computer algebra. Both times, I found the material strangely "different" from the computational problems I was used to solving in the normal high school curriculum. Although it's been a few years since I last worked with abstract algebra, I've overcome the learning curve. I'm familiar with the standard structures such as groups, rings, and fields.</p>

        <h2>Combinatorics</h2>
        <p>I took a introductory combinatorics class in college as part of my math minor. We explored standard counting topics such as permutations, recurrences, and generating functions. We also covered topics in graph theory such as paths and matchings. I especially appreciated gaining better intuition for graph theory problems.</p>

        <h2>Probability</h2>
        <p>I completed an introductory probability course in college as part of my math minor. I'm familiar with common distributions such as the Poisson and Exponential distributions. I've solved many computational exercises involving distributions and also have a decent intuition for applying probability to machine learning problems.</p>

        <h2>LaTeX</h2>
        <p>Today, I write up most of my work in LaTeX. I almost always type up my solutions to math homework and have a set of texts describing how machine learning classifiers such as support vector machines work. I learn additional packages on an ad-hoc basis. Recently, I've started generating my own plots using <code>pgfplots</code>. Here is a sample document I wrote in January 2016: <a href=res/SVM_derivations.pdf target="_blank">Support Vector Machine Derivations.</a></p>
