    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 years of experience (including industry).</li>
        <li>Contributed to 30+ repositories (including private) on Github.</li>
        <li>Maintained around 800 commits per year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>I primarily use Git for version control. The only exception has been when I interned at Google, which uses a different internal version control tool. I'm completely comfortable with basic Git workflow such as commiting, branching, and merging. I've used Git for long enough that I no longer feel comfortable developing without it. Today, almost all the non-experimental code that I own is on Github.</p>
