        <h1>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h1>
    </center>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 years of coursework, 6 courses.</li>
        <li>4 significant projects, 9 course assignments.</li>
        <li>Mostly use python, Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow. Some MATLAB.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence is a new interest I discovered in college. It is also my main focus at the moment. I'm interested in artificial intelligence because its results seem magical at times. I have taken or am enrolled in six courses related to artificial intelligence. Four are/were at the University of Michigan, and two are/were on Coursera. In addition, I've worked on a decent number of artificial intelligence projects in a variety of subfields such as natural language processing, image processing, or graph mining.</p>
    
    <h2>My Interest in Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>I chose to focus on artificial intelligence because of its seemingly magical results. When I started out programming, I was like a person being introduced to electricity for the first time. I was amazed by simple tools such as graphing calculators because they could perform a task better than I could. Today, I'm more modernized and no longer fascinated by these tools because I've created many of them myself. The magic disappears once you discover the tricks.</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence is the next magical frontier for me. In some cases, it can perform a task I cannot do, such as determining the party affiliation of a politician based solely on his/her corporate donors. In other situations, it can "write" a program that I cannot, such as a image recognizer. Artificial intelligence is breaking through the boundaries of traditional programming logic and giving machines more and more abilities that can be put to good use in society. It's truly producing "magical" results and I'm driven to understand the mechanics of the "tricks."</p>
