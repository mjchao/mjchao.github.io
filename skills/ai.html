        <h1>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h1>
    </center>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 years of coursework, 6 courses.</li>
        <li>4 significant projects, 9 course assignments.</li>
        <li>Mostly use Python, Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow. Some MATLAB.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence is a new interest I discovered in college. It is also my main focus at the moment. I'm interested in artificial intelligence because its results seem magical at times. I have taken or am enrolled in six courses related to artificial intelligence. Four are/were at the University of Michigan, and two are/were on Coursera. In addition, I've worked on a decent number of artificial intelligence projects in a variety of subfields such as natural language processing, image processing, and graph mining.</p>
    
    <h2>My Interest in Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>I chose to focus on artificial intelligence because of its seemingly magical results. When I started out programming, I was like a person being introduced to electricity for the first time. I was amazed by simple tools such as graphing calculators because they could perform a task better than I could. Today, I'm more modernized and no longer fascinated by these tools because I've created many of them myself. The magic disappears once you discover the tricks.</p>
    <p>Artificial intelligence is the next magical frontier for me. In some cases, it can perform a task I cannot do, such as determining the party affiliation of a politician based solely on his/her corporate donors. In other situations, it can "write" a program that I cannot, such as an image recognizer. Artificial intelligence is breaking through the boundaries of traditional programming logic and giving machines more and more abilities that can be put to good use in society. It's truly producing "magical" results and I'm driven to understand the mechanics of the "tricks."</p>

    <h2>Coursework</h2>
    <p>For many practical aspects of computer science such as general software engineering, user interfaces, or competitive programming, I've generally learned by doing. I find artificial intelligence is one of the harder areas to learn solely from project experience. I believe it requires significant intuition taught via formal instruction and supplemented by hands-on projects.</p>
    <p>Here are a number of relevant courses I have taken or will take:</p>

    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
    <h4>Coursera &emsp; June - August 2015</h4>
    <p>While I was interning at Jump Trading, I heard about applications of machine learning to algorithmic trading. It wasn't anything particularly in-depth, but it sparked my interest. After speaking with friends, I heard that Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera was a great place to start. I successfully completed this course in the evenings after coming home from work. This was my first exposure to machine learning and I was extremely impressed by the clarity with which Andrew Ng explained the concepts. Although it wasn't extremely detailed in terms of the mathematics, I think I obtained a good intuition for concepts such as logistic regression. I also completed several small programming assignments using MATLAB.</p>

    <h3>Intro to Artificial Intelligence (EECS 492)</h3>
    <h4>University of Michigan &emsp; September - December 2015</h4>
    <p>I took this course in the fall semester of my sophomore year of college. I had skipped to junior year in coursework, but I had too few credits at the university and was the last of the juniors to register. Surprisingly, this was one of the few courses that were still open - mostly because it had a reputation of being boring and not as well taught as the machine learning course.</p>
    <p>The course was a broad survey starting with brute-force searching, progressing to logic, and then ending with probabilistic models and some machine learning. As one of the course projects, I implemented the genetic search algorithm that generated my portrait on the "About Me" page of this website. I was also fascinated by logic for about another half of a year until I realized proofs and knowledgebases probably would not generalize very well. Unfortunately, I didn't follow many of the lectures on probabilistic models and machine learning. By the time we reached concepts such as support vector machines or reinforcement learning, the instructor was getting tripped up as well. Luckily, I would gain a stronger understanding of the material the following semester in my machine learning course. Overall, the course deepened my interest in artificial intelligence.</p>

    <h3>Intro to Machine Learning (EECS 445)</h3>
    <h4>University of Michigan &emsp; January - April 2016</h4>
    <p>Intro to Machine Learning was probably the <i>best</i> course I ever took at the University of Michigan. Again, I had issues with registration and ended up on waitlist spot #70 in a class of capacity 140. I decided to gamble and stay on the waitlist instead of taking my backup course with a conflicting lecture time. Luckily for me, over half the class was overconfident and truly couldn't handle the mathematics. I got off the waitlist within a few weeks. I was determined to make the most out of this opportunity because the instructor's teaching style strongly resonated with my learning process and I had decided that I wanted to focus my studies on artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p>The machine learning course at my university covered many standard topics and as the course progressed, I made an effort to rederive the mathematics behind each model on my own. Here is a list of topics and my derivations (those without links have not been reviewed and converted to LaTeX yet):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regression (linear, <a href=res/logistic_regression.pdf target="_blank">logistic)</a></li>
        <li><a href=res/svm.pdf target="_blank">Support vector machines</a></li>
        <li>Ensemble methods (<a href=res/decision_trees.pdf target="_blank">Decision Trees</a>, Bagging, Random Forests, <a href=res/boosting.pdf target="_blank">Boosting</a>)</li>
        <li><a href=res/neural_networks.pdf target="_blank">Neural networks</a></li>
        <li>Clustering</li>
        <li>Bayesian networks</li>
        <li><a href=res/expectation_maximization.pdf target="_blank">Expectation maximization and Gaussian mixture models</a></li>
        <li>Hidden Markov models</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These derivations strongly reinforced my understanding. For example, I achieved the second highest score on the midterm exam. I also gained greater comfort with much of the theory and mathematics behind machine learning.
    </p>

    <h3>Mining Large-Scale Graph Data (EECS 598)</h3>
    <h4>University of Michigan &emsp; September - December 2016</h4>
    <p>This was a graduate-level selected topics course. I wanted experience something different from the typical undergraduate curriculum and I knew it would be taught well because it was the professor's research area. The course consisted of a broad overview of graph mining research papers, two programming assignments, and one open-ended project. This was another one of my enjoyable courses, particularly because of the flexibility of the open-ended project.</p>
    <p>Students were required to give presentations on research papers and I gave a brief talk on Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (Kleinberg). There were around 30 other presentations including topics such as fraud detection and deep learning for graphs. I also directly applied methods discussed in class, such as tensor decomposition and community detection, in my programming assignments.</p>
    <p>My group's open-ended project analyzed political graphs. We showed it was possible to distinguish between Democrats and Republicans based solely on their corporate donors and with no knowledge of their voting records. Furthermore, we showed there was an anomaly shortly after the passage of Citizens United, when it became significantly easier to determine a legislator's party affiliation based on donations. Our observations provided conclusive evidence that corporate donations are surprisingly systematic and suggested that organizations, including nonprofit ones, may have a strong influence on politics and warrant greater scrutiny.</p>

    <h3>Neural Networks for Machine Learning</h3>
    <h4>Coursera &emsp; December 2016 - March 2017</h4>
    <p>I discovered this course while on Thanksgiving break in 2016. I had some free time and winter break was approaching, so I figured I could handle a bit more work. The instructor, Geoffrey Hinton, was a well-known expert in the field and explained things very well, so I stuck through the entire 16 weeks.</p>
    <p>The course covered a variety of different topics in neural networks. There were the usual topics such as convolution and recurrent neural networks  of which I had some background knowledge from previous machine learning experiences, and then there were belief networks, which were completely new to me. Most of the course went smoothly, though I struggled a bit with the belief networks. Overall, I received a broad introduction to many of the newer ideas in the field.</p>

    <h2>Current Goal</h2>
    <p>My current interest in artificial intelligence is exploring neural networks. I am especially fascinated by the recent results of researchers and my next personal goal is to focus on handwriting recognition and create a program to automatically score handwritten coding exams. A secondary goal is to improve the interpretability of these models. Although grading handwritten code is not a life-or-death situation, I believe interpretability will shed more light on how the models work.</p>
