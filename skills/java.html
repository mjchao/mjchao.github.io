	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Java is my second programming language, and the first language for which I had formal instruction. I started using it during Fall 2011 for an introductory computer science course and it was my primary programming language throughout high school. As a rough estimate, I probably have around 30 projects/experiments totaling 100,000 lines of written Java code that cover a number of nontrivial parts of the language.</p>

	<h2>Experiences</h2>
	<p>Java provides a wealth of libraries. I have experience applying several features of the language in the past. Here are some of them.</p>
	
	<h3>User Interfaces</h3>
	<p>I have created many user interfaces with Java Swing. I am experienced in using layouts and panels to present content to a user and applying event handlers from Java AWT to enable interaction. I have also taken user interfaces written in Swing and created near-identical copies with JavaFX.</p>

	<h3>Networking</h3>
	<p>The majority of my experience working with clients and servers has been with Java desktop applications (not with websites - surprisingly). I've implemented a functional, though unoptimized, database, and a variety of networked applications, such as chatrooms, collaborative whiteboards, and phone-call applications. I used sockets frequently for TCP and UDP and even developed a standard skeleton that I personally use to quickly set up client/server interactions. Outside of desktop applications, I have also created a simple web-based chatroom that communicates via Websockets with a Java server.</p>

	<h3>Multithreading</h3>
	<p>Most of my multithreading knowledge comes from experience. As I've implemented many networked applications, I've dealt with multithreading frequently. The Java <code>synchronized</code> keyword thankfully fixes many concurrency problems, but I have had to deal with race conditions when working with multiple clients. I have also adressed shared resources while using C++ for other projects.</p>

	<h3>Graphics</h3>
	<p>I worked with the Java 3D library and its successor that came with JavaFX. I primarily used the API to position simple 3D objects. These libraries were useful when I created meshes to graph 3D functions, such as paraboloids, and when I wanted to visualize my physics engine's calculations.</p>

	<h3>Symbolic Computation</h3>
	<p>One of my side interests has been symbolic computation. As an object-oriented programming language, Java has been useful for abstracting out structures such as functions, numbers, and operators. In high school, I created several abstractions that allowed the computer to expand most algebraic expressions. I was also interested in symbolic integration. Unfortunately, that path led to some extremely complicated abstract algebra that I wasn't ready to handle. Recently, I've applied similar concepts to logic and implemented algorithms to parse an expression tree and apply resolution to prove statements from simple knowledgebases.</p>
