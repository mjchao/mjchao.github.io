                    <p>Java was the first programming language I learned in school. I've
            worked with user interfaces, 3D graphics, and TCP and UDP
            networking. When I used to participate in competitive programming
            competitions, I would implement my solutions in Java.</p>
            <p>Java is an excellent language that comes with plenty of
            well-documented and well-designed libraries for a broad range of
            tasks. I had confidence that if Java had the libraries for a certain
            task, I could easily follow and extend upon a few  tutorials to
            figure out how to accomplish my goal. The uniformity of the
            libraries was very appealing and I had much success in my early
            programming years using Java.
            <p>Recently, I've been using Java less because other languages have
            been more suitable for specific tasks at hand. For example,
            C++ allows for the speed and low-level, custom optimizations I need
            at work. Python has popular machine learning libraries that
            allow for quickly coding up experiments. And I don't really build
            user interfaces much anymore.</p>
            <p>My strength lies in the massive amounts of code I've
            written in Java. Back in high school, I wrote tens of thousands of
            lines of code for a wide range of fun personal projects. The 
            experiences made me comfortable with the design patterns and 
            although my knowledge of the Java libraries is a bit
            outdated now, I can easily catch up when I need to use Java for
            a project again.</p>
