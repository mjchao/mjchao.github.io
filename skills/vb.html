        <h1>Visual Basic and VBA</h1>
        </center>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>My first programming language.</li>
                <li>~3 years, unknown number of projects, &gt;10,000 lines of code.</li>
                <li>Worked with user interfaces, Excel.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I started programming with Visual Basic in sixth grade. This was my first programming language. I primarily made text-based games. I paid little attention to coding style and structure; however, the benefit was that I gained practice debugging and managing thousands of lines of code in my head. As a fun fact, I developed all my games without ever writing a Visual Basic Function (I did use Subs, though, which are like functions with no return value), a for loop, an object, or an array. Another fun fact is that all my code is saved on two very old machines: one runs Windows Millenium and one runs Windows XP. I don't use Visual Basic frequently today, but when I do, I primarily apply it to Excel applications.</p>

        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <p>Here are some descriptions of my work with Excel and VBA and then a bit about my childhood games.</p>

        <h3>Excel</h3>
        <p>Microsoft Excel is quite powerful and not as intimidating as a programming language. When I process my own data, I probably write a Python program and use the Pandas library. When I process data for nontechnical people, they are often intimidated by terminals and code and Excel is a much better alternative. For example, in my very first internship as a Client Services intern, I loaded my department's employee data into a spreadsheet. I implemented search functionality to allow people to quickly find the representative for a specific region. Of course, this was more complicated than simple text matching because I had to associate places in a region to the entire region. For example, "Massachusetts" is part of the "New England" and "United States" regions.</p>

        <h3>Games</h3>
        <p>As a child, I enjoyed computer games to an unhealthy extent and my parents consequently limited my time on the computer and internet. I accepted the alternative of programming games myself. Since I had limited access to graphics, the majority of them were text-based. Two games that stand out in my memory are my text-based role-playing game and a tower defense game.</p>
        <p>My RPG essentially allowed the player to walk around, kill monsters, buy/sell equipment, and level up. It randomly generated text for encountering monsters and dealing damage. In addition, it maintained a character inventory and provided "cheat codes" for getting bonuses. I was rather proud when I brought it into school on a flash drive and several other students started playing it.</p>
        <p>My tower defense game allowed the user to buy and upgrade up to 16 turrets. The attacker was essentially a button with the health printed on it. As the user killed more attackers, the new attackers gained more health and speed. The player could also manage an economy that produced resources necessary for turret upgrades. Finally, I added in a "roulette wheel" that allowed the user to gamble for bonuses. The wheel was actually animated and the user could watch the highlighted bonus change as the wheel "spun."</p>
        <p>Overall, my games often reached several thousand lines of code each and they were challenging to debug. I used goto's frequently, I only used while loops, and all my variables were global. Each new bug was a challenging logic puzzle, but I didn't really have much else to do in my spare time anyways. I think it was rewarding to have experienced the early kind of programming that disregarded maintainability. I definitely learned many lessons and developed better ideas for debugging.</p>
