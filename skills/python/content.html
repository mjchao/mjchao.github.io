Python is probably my favorite language. I like it because it is expressive, user-friendly, and conducive to hiding away complexity. A common mistake I see in Python programming is throwing code quality out the door because the language is so flexible; consequently, there’s a good amount of negativity towards Python because it is conducive to bad style. Personally, I show some restraint, follow some standards, and the result is clean and maintainable code. As an added bonus, Python code is easier to read and the development process is faster and less painful than many other languages.

I’ve used Python for machine learning, prototyping, and regression testing legacy code. In machine learning, I’ve worked with scikit-learn, tensorflow, numpy, scipy, and other related libraries. The libraries cover up the nitty-gritty algorithm implementation details and allow users to focus on coming up with the appropriate models.

Python is an excellent prototyping language thanks to it’s duck-typing. If I mess up my first prototype, I can easily change the designs without having to spend a day fixing compiler errors. I always throw away prototyping code when I’m done and that prevents bad code from getting into the final product.

Finally, Python is great for wrapping around complex, legacy code. When I come across highly-tangled code that has no unit tests and cannot be unit tested, I will write a Python wrapper around the executable binary and automate end-to-end tests. The expressiveness of Python makes it fast to throw together a test harness and the automated tests make code maintenance much easier.
