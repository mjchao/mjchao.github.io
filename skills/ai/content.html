I focused on artificial intelligence during my undergraduate studies. I found AI to be an additional “level” of magical beyond normal programs. I used to think graphing calculators were magical, but when I saw algorithms recognizing my handwriting, I knew that was a totally different and awesome kind of magic.

The majority of my practical experience has been representing entities (e.g. words, paragraphs, politicians) with embeddings, interpreting those embeddings, and applying them to problems. The embeddings are learned by neural networks, which detect patterns that humans could not have noticed.

I’ve also taken general artificial intelligence classes and I’m familiar with a variety of standard methods and am comfortable reading papers on new ideas.
