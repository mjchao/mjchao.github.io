            <p>I focused on artifical intelligence during my undergraduate
            studies. I found its results to be an additional "level" of magical
            beyond normal programs. For example, calculators were cool, but
            handwriting recognition was way more impressive. At the end of the
            day, I understood that much of it was overglorified (e.g. machine
            learning is pretty much just dressed-up optimization), but I
            enjoyed the applicability of the discipline and chose to study it
            in greater depth.</p>
            <p>A lot of my work has been representing things (e.g. words,
            paragraphs, politicians) with embeddings and interpreting what the
            embeddings represent. The embeddings are always learned by
            neural networks, which tend to represent things that may be too
            subtle for humans to notice. One can make a lot of interesting
            discoveries from embeddings generated by neural networks.</p>
            <p>I've also taken general artificial intelligence classes, so I'm
            familiar with a variety of standard methods and am comfortable
            reading papers on new ideas.</p>
