I believe that one overlooked topic in many computer science curriculums (and other disciplines too!) is technical communication. I didn’t enjoy it at first, but I learned to appreciate its importance when I started working in massive codebases.

A team will always do better than a single person and software engineering is very much a collaborative effort. Bad coding style and no documentation kills the collaboration because code that only the author understands is useless once the author moves on. Therefore, I always make it my priority to ensure anyone else can easily pick up my code without needing a lecture from me.

I’ve written documents for my own code and rarely get questions from users. I’ve written documents for other people’s code and saved weeks of new developers’ time. I’m also comfortable rehearsing for and giving presentations. Technical communication is an important foundation in software engineering that I feel no team should ever skimp out on.
