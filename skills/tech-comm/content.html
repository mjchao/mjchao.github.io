            <p>I believe that one overlooked topic in many computer science
                curriculums (and other disciplines too!) is technical
                communication. I didn't enjoy it at first, but I started to
                appreciate it when I started working in massive codebases.</p>
            <p>At Google, I could not have possibly gotten anything done without
                document after document detailing how to accomplish certain
                tasks with certain modules and comment after comment explaining
                why the code was written as it was. And having undergone
                rigorous review, the content of those resources was pristine.
                </p>
            <p>I made an effort to emulate this when I wrote my text-reuse
                detection pipeline at ProQuest. I did not want my product
                manager struggling to figure out how to use my code after my
                internship and I made sure to leave him with very clear and
                detailed documents. When we caught up over lunch one day, he
                told me that he was even able to apply my algorithms to new
                datasets and it worked like a charm. At that moment, I knew I
                had succeeded in effective technical communication.</p>
            <p>Technical communication is one of those "an ounce of prevention
                is worth a pound of cure" things. Any large-scale project in
                which collaborators choose to skimp on their documentation pays
                dearly in the long run - mainly when people move on. And
                although communicating my work makes me more disposable, it's
                the right thing to do as a professional.</p>
