	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>My second programming language in school.</li>
		<li>3 years, ~10 projects totaling ~20,000 lines of code.</li>
		<li>Worked with STL, networking.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>C++ is my third programming language, and the second language for which I had formal instruction. The introductory programming courses at the University of Michigan are all taught in C++, which required me to pick up the language. C++ is also the primary language I have used in internship projects. As a rough estimate, I probably have around 10 projects (including course projects) totaling aproximately 20,000 lines of code. I have primarily been using the STL and done a little bit of networking.</p>

	<h2>Experiences</h2>
	<p>C++ is a huge language and I have worked on a few large projects that cover a few features the language and libraries offer.</p>

	<h3>STL</h3>
	<p>The STL is a key library in C++ that most C++ developers should know. I used it frequently in class projects and during internships. For example, I can easily use containers and have familiarity with <code>functional, thread</code> and <code>atomic</code>.</p>

	<h3>Networking</h3>
	<p>I have also done a little bit of networking with C sockets (<code>sys/socket.h</code>). I've set up a command-line based chatroom and also worked with sockets to test software that communicates with a stock exchange. Since the high-level procedure for sending and receiving messages among computers in C/C++ is pretty much identical to the procedure used in Java, the only challenge was learning the API for C sockets.
