	<h1>Python</h1>

	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>My third programming language in school.</li>2.5 years, ~5 projects totaling ~10000 lines of code.</li>
		<li>Worked with machine learning, user interfaces.</li>
		<li>Libraries: <code>sklearn, tensorflow, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, Tkinter, pygame, Flask</code></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Python is my fourth programming language, and the third language for which I had formal instruction. My first exposure was in a class called "Gaming for the Greater Good" in which we developed games for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Afterwards, I have primarily used Python for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. I probably have around 5 significant projects/experiments that total about 10,000 lines of written Python code.
	</p>

	<h2>Experiences</h2>
        Most of my Python experience has dealt with machine learning. My fluency in Python has also allowed me to apply the language to a variety of other tasks such as user interfaces and web development.

	<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
	I primarily use Scikit-Learn for machine learning because I like its straightforward <code>fit</code> and <code>predict</code> api, its excellent documentation, and its lack of esoteric required parameters. I use Tensorflow when I need to apply neural networks. I'm also familiar with the standard data processing libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I often have to consult the documentation when I use these libraries, but I have used some common operations enough times to have them memorized (e.g. creating a scatter plot, list unqiue elements in an array).

	<h3>User Interfaces</h3>
	Tkinter user interfaces have several parallels with Java Swing, so I haven't found them too difficult to build. I've made a few small user interfaces for presenting results of machine learning algorithms. 
        I've also used Pygame to build the game in my "Gaming for the Greater Good" class. It was rather difficult to create standard UI components such as buttons and their pressed/unpressed animations. However, I gained quite a bit of experience managing sprites in the game window.

        <h3>Server-Side Web Development</h3>
        Most of my web development has been in class. In my course "Web Database and Information Systems," I built three versions of a photo-sharing website. The first version dynamically rendered Jinja templates on the server side. The second version still rendered Jinja templates on the server but it also incorporated sessions and authentication and permitted more flexibility for editing photos. The third version converted the second version to be updated dynamically on the client-side with Javascript that used AJAX to access a RESTful API on the server side.

        <h3>Networking</h3>
        (Ongoing) In my "Web Database and Information Systems" course, I also implemented a naive distributed MapReduce framework and implemented a PageRank algorithm to run on the MapReduce framework.
