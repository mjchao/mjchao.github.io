                    <p>Python is the third major progamming language I picked up. Most
            of my Python work has been for machine learning, but if someone
            asked me to solve an unclear problem, I'd probably end up using
            Python because of its forgiving nature.</p>
            <p>I'm familiar with standard machine learning libraries like
            sckit-learn and tensorflow. I'm also comfortable with numeric
            libraries like numpy and scipy. The effectiveness of these libraries
            and accesibility of other libraries for more-specialized tasks makes
            Python my standard choice for machine learning.</p>
            <p>I also appreciate being able to get things working quickly in
            Python. If prototyping and I make a small mistake (such as with
            types and subtypes), I can easily bypass it with a quick fix. Of
            course, for any polished products, I always will make sure the
            design works without flaws. It's also much easier to abstract
            thing out with Python. For example, things that might require
            massive and fragile templating in C++ are easily bypassed with
            Python's duck-typing. It's truly a "user-friendly" language, where
            the user is the programmer for once.</p>
