	<h1>Technical Communication</h1>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Experienced in wroting documentation for projects.</li>
            <li>Experienced in executing presentations for projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I definitely agree that writing code deserves the majority of the effort on a project. At the same time, and perhaps contrary to many people's beliefs, I find that technical communication is a vital aspect of any endeavour and it isn't something one can just pick up and do "properly." In college, I took technical communication classes, and throughout my internships, I applied my skills to producing quality documentation and presentations for my team and managers.</p> 

        <h2>Project Documentation</h2>
        <p>There are many documents that coding projects require. I've written requirement and design documents. While working as a quality assurance intern at Jump Trading, I generated requirements documentation with software engineers. Afterwards, I created a test plan document and proceeded to build my test framework after it was approved. The project went smoothly and successfully. At Google, I built a component for a machine learning pipeline and towards the end of my internship, I created a thorough document describing the inner workings of my modules and how to maintain them so that they remain in use after I left.</p>

        <h2>Presentations</h2>
        <p>I have given many presentations in school and during my internships. I generally receive positive feedback and successfully communicate complicated material in a short period of time. I rehearse frequently and listen to myself to better understand what an audience experiences. I place heavy emphasis on my choice of visuals because I realize that they are more effective than words in a short span of time. In the past, I have managed to explain complicated algorithms, such as noise constrastive estimation loss for word vectors, in ten minutes. I've also given effective end-of-internship project presentations.</p>
