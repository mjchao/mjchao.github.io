          <div class="content">
            <p>C++ is the primary language I use at my current job. I can write
                C++ code for most language agnostic tasks, like sending data
                over sockets and implementation of common algorithms.</p>
            <p>One of my strengths is writing correct and maintainable code. I
                pay a lot of attention to my style and am never comfortable
                releasing anything without a suite of regression tests to catch
                my own errors and errors that someone else after me might make.
                </p>
            <p>I can usually come up with an algorithm of the best theoretical
                complexity. When making use of C++'s speed, I'm careful not to
                waste runtime doing things twice. That goes for any language,
                anyhow. Finally, I try my best to take cache locality into
                consideration.</p>
            <p>Most of my C++ projects have been proprietary for
                internships and for my current job, so they may not make much
                sense outside of the company. At Google, one part of my
                machine learning pipeline was a C++ program for extracting and
                preprocessing a massive amount of training data (billions of
                words!). At Jump Trading, I also created a test framework to
                perform regression testing on some custom order submission
                software.

          <h3>Java</h3>
          <img src="images/java.png"></img>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Java was the first programming language I learned in school. I've
            worked with user interfaces, 3D graphics, and TCP and UDP
            networking. When I used to participate in competitive programming
            competitions, I would implement my solutions in Java.</p>
            <p>Java is an excellent language that comes with plenty of
            well-documented and well-designed libraries for a broad range of
            tasks. I had confidence that if Java had the libraries for a certain
            task, I could easily follow and extend upon a few  tutorials to
            figure out how to accomplish my goal. The uniformity of the
            libraries was very appealing and I had much success in my early
            programming years using Java.
            <p>Recently, I've been using Java less because other languages have
            been more suitable for specific tasks at hand. For example,
            C++ allows for the speed and low-level, custom optimizations I need
            at work. Python has popular machine learning libraries that
            allow for quickly coding up experiments. And I don't really build
            user interfaces much anymore.</p>
            <p>My strength lies in the massive amounts of code I've
            written in Java. Back in high school, I wrote tens of thousands of
            lines of code for a wide range of fun personal projects. The 
            experiences made me comfortable with the design patterns and 
            although my knowledge of the Java libraries is a bit
            outdated now, I can easily catch up when I need to use Java for
            a project again.</p>

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <img src="images/python.png"></img>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Python is the third major progamming language I picked up. Most
            of my Python work has been for machine learning, but if someone
            asked me to solve an unclear problem, I'd probably end up using
            Python because of its forgiving nature.</p>
            <p>I'm familiar with standard machine learning libraries like
            sckit-learn and tensorflow. I'm also comfortable with numeric
            libraries like numpy and scipy. The effectiveness of these libraries
            and accesibility of other libraries for more-specialized tasks makes
            Python my standard choice for machine learning.</p>
            <p>I also appreciate being able to get things working quickly in
            Python. If prototyping and I make a small mistake (such as with
            types and subtypes), I can easily bypass it with a quick fix. Of
            course, for any polished products, I always will make sure the
            design works without flaws. It's also much easier to abstract
            thing out with Python. For example, things that might require
            massive and fragile templating in C++ are easily bypassed with
            Python's duck-typing. It's truly a "user-friendly" language, where
            the user is the programmer for once.</p>

          <h3>Technical Communication</h3>

          <div class="content">
            <p>I believe that one overlooked topic in many computer science
                curriculums (and other disciplines too!) is technical
                communication. I didn't enjoy it at first, but I started to
                appreciate it when I started working in massive codebases.</p>
            <p>At Google, I could not have possibly gotten anything done without
                document after document detailing how to accomplish certain
                tasks with certain modules and comment after comment explaining
                why the code was written as it was. And having undergone
                rigorous review, the content of those resources was pristine.
                </p>
            <p>I made an effort to emulate this when I wrote my text-reuse
                detection pipeline at ProQuest. I did not want my product
                manager struggling to figure out how to use my code after my
                internship and I made sure to leave him with very clear and
                detailed documents. When we caught up over lunch one day, he
                told me that he was even able to apply my algorithms to new
                datasets and it worked like a charm. At that moment, I knew I
                had succeeded in effective technical communication.</p>
            <p>Technical communication is one of those "an ounce of prevention
                is worth a pound of cure" things. Any large-scale project in
                which collaborators choose to skimp on their documentation pays
                dearly in the long run - mainly when people move on. And
                although communicating my work makes me more disposable, it's
                the right thing to do as a professional.</p>
