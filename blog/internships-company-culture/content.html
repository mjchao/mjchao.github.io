In the last two posts, we talked about how to do a good job on your intern project and benefit your company. In the post and the next one, we’re going to look at how to use your internship summer to benefit yourself. This article will explore one important question that you should keep in mind and answer by the end of your internship: “Would I want to work here full-time?”
</p>
<h2>
Would I Want to Work Here Full-Time?
</h2>
<p>
Companies always ask “would I want this intern as a full-time employee?” and you on the other side should also ask, “would I want to work for this company full-time?” This article goes over how to determine if the company culture is right for you. Some important aspects of company culture to consider are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>People around you</li>
	<li>Company growth</li>
	<li>Your growth</li>
</ul>
<p>
The above list contains some of the important points to consider and we’ll go over them in this article. But keep in mind the list is not exhaustive and you will have other things in your personal life to consider.
</p>
<h2>
People
</h2>
<p>
When you join full-time, you will see the same people day after day, so make sure the people at your company are people you want to work with. Take every opportunity you have to meet other people in the company, whether it be an informal department social, or a formal event such as “meet the CEO.” If you don’t feel comfortable, remember that the feeling is all in your head - it’s not like a lion will pop up from behind a chair and eat you for an appetizer at happy hour. Here are a few tips if you’re not as comfortable wading into a crowd of unfamiliar people:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rehearse some icebreakers and your answer to “what do you do?”</li>
	<li>Prepare some knowledge of current events, both within and outside the company, for smalltalk</li>
	<li>Bring your smile with you</li>
	<li>Maintain eye contact around 80% - 90% of the time</li>
	<li>Listen to others instead of thinking about what you’re going to say next</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now let’s assume you’ve begun the smalltalk and have gotten into a conversation with someone; we need to come up with your agenda: what are you trying to gain from talking to people? After you’ve talked about some standard topics like the weather, weekend plans, or favorite alcoholic beverage, here are a few topics towards which to steer your conversation:
</p>
<p>
<b>Anything you wish could change about the company?</b> If you hear complaints, especially repeated ones, then that should serve as a red flag to you. Know that if you join full-time, you will have to deal with that complaint. At the same time, listen to their tone when they complain. If the people you talk with seem unreasonable, or complain a lot, then maybe there are some problematic employees.
</p>
<p>
<b>Favorite aspect of the company?</b> On the other hand, if you hear a lot of people saying how much they love working at the company, that’s a good sign.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why did you join the company?</b> Knowing why people are joining the company illustrates the positives. But if you consistently don’t get strong reasons, then start asking yourself if people are joining just to get a job, which indicates lack of skill or motivation in the company.
</p>
<p>
<b>How long have you been at the firm for?</b> Getting a sense of the median tenure of employees tells you about the turnover rate. If everyone is new and the company hasn’t announced an unprecedented wave of hiring, then that suggests the majority of people don’t stick around and maybe you should leave too. If you meet a fair number of senior people (five or more years), then that’s a good sign - there must be a reason why these people stuck around.
</p>
<p>
Use your questions to learn more about the company culture, but at the same time, think about if you enjoyed talking with the people. Most of the time, it’ll be neutral and that’s okay because most people don’t naturally exude warmth, especially when talking to a stranger for the first time. If you frequently have enjoyable experiences, then that’s a sign the people are wonderful and you’ve struck gold. On the other hand, if you frequently have unenjoyable experiences, think about the reasons why that could be:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Were you too anxious?</b> Then that’s on you and you’ll get better with more practice.</li>
	<li><b>Were people too different from you?</b> Practically speaking, people get along with people similar to them. If everyone is twice your age and nobody shares your interests, then you’re going to have a difficult social life as a full-time employee.</li>
	<li><b>Were people giving off the wrong vibe?</b> If you don’t feel comfortable with a lot of people’s tones or behaviors, then that’s a sign the culture is not for you. If you feel like people were pushy or arrogant or ridiculous, then maybe that’s something you want to avoid by not joining full-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
People are a great source of implied information and you should take advantage of opportunities to talk to more people and figure out if you think the company environment suits you.
</p>
<h2>
Future Growth of the Company
</h2>
<p>
Future company growth is another aspect you should always consider before joining full-time. In general, you should prefer companies that are headed uphill as opposed to plateaued or headed downhill. More growth means more exciting projects you can take on and more rewards for hard work.
</p>
<p>
Talk to people and ask them about the projects they’re working on to get a sense of where the new developments are. Listen to executives when they address the entire company. And do some research on your own about the market that your company is establishing itself in. See if you can answer this important question: “What is the company’s plan for expanding in the next few years?” Do you believe it is both reasonable and feasible? If yes, then that’s a good sign. If not, then you should take that as a red flag.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, look for any troubles in the company’s past. While the past does not perfectly foretell the future, it is a strong indicator. Has the company done a lot of restructuring before? If yes, that indicates its financials are unstable and you could get laid off in an economic downturn. Do people online post about the company reneging on offers? If yes, then be aware that your full-time offer could be rescinded too. Make sure you are aware of your company’s operating philosophy and how it will affect the company’s trajectory in the future.
</p>
<h2>
Future Growth of Employees
</h2>
<p>
In addition to your company’s trajectory, you want to know if you yourself can grow at the company. Although it’s early in your career, you should try to visualize a desirable career path at the company, no matter how vague it may be.
</p>
<p>
Again, talk to people and ask them when they joined, and how they have developed during their time since. Did they end up specializing in a certain domain? Did they become the expert in a particular area of a codebase? Did they transfer to different teams since they started? How did they get to where they are today? The people around you are indicators of what your situation will be like a few years down the road if you join full-time.
</p>
<p>
Then, reference what you’ve learned against the desirable career path(s) that you envisioned. For example, suppose you really want to end up in a product manager role, but the company is only willing to hire you full-time as a software engineer. Then do you see any people transferring from software engineer to product manager a few years down the line? If yes, then great, but if the majority of people fail to make the transfer, then that’s not favorable for you and you may not be able to grow in the way you want. Of course, people’s plans change all the time and some people are open to many different career paths, but at least have some notion of a career plan and make sure it’ll be achievable at the company.
</p>

No Company is Perfect
</h2>
<p>
No company has the perfect culture and every company will probably fail in some area I described above. It is difficult to have warm and welcoming people who all love your mission, and have an amazing future outlook on the company’s growth, and be the perfect place for you to grow as an engineer. The primary purpose of doing all the detective work in this article is so that you know as much as you can up front about the company culture before you commit full-time. Once you have all the facts about company culture, you can weigh the pros and cons and decide for yourself if your intern company is the right place to commit to full-time.
