This blog contains tips on how to do well in the computer science major during your college undergraduate years. All posts are self-contained and you can read whichever ones interest you.  Some posts are part of a series, and it is recommended, but not required, to read them sequentially. Please help yourself to whatever content interests you. The following sections describe the goals of the blog and outline what’s coming in the future.
</p>
<h2>
How to Succeed in Coursework
</h2>
<p>
College is usually graded on a curve and people are always worrying about the average, but what if you just always scored above 93% on an absolute scale? During my college years, I rarely had to worry about the curve. And when I graduated with my bachelor's in computer science engineering degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, I had a near-perfect GPA. There are many nuances to learning material and performing your best when exams roll around; I'll share those ideas in my blog posts. 
</p>
<h2>
How to Succeed at the Job Search
</h2>
<p>
You gain a valuable skillset in college, but how do you convince companies that's the case? Having experience and confidence helps you sell yourself to companies. Doing so eloquently puts you at a competitive advantage. I spent three years in undergrad and gained valuable experiences from three summer internships (four if you count a non-technical one). Currently, I work full-time at a fantastic company and can picture myself staying there long-term. In the following blog posts, I'll also provide tips on putting yourself in the best light when talking to recruiters or interviewing.
</p>
<h2>
What’s Coming in the Future
</h2>
<p>
By the end of 2018, I should have a table of contents and a discussion platform for the posts. I anticipate adding a new post every few weeks. Here are some more topics you can expect posts on:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Meal plans, housing, and general college tips</li>
	<li>Autograders, recursion, and best practices for succeeding in computer science courses</li>
	<li>A 10+ post series on internships and full-time positions</li>
</ul>
<p>
The articles can be grouped into three major categories: college in general, specifics of the computer science major, and the job search. Stay tuned for more!
