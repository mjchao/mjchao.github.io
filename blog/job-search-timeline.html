      <p>
You’re probably attending college to get a well-paying job after you graduate. If you’re studying computer science, then you’re in luck because technology is one of the hottest and best-paid sectors. If you gain the proper experiences during your time in college, you will almost-certainly get an excellent full-time job. The job search portion of this blog discusses various actions you can take to secure a full-time position when you graduate. In this post, we’ll take a high-level look at the journey ahead.
</p>
<p>
There will be four sections of the timeline: one for each year of college. Each section will have a description of goals for that year and the relevant topics that will be discussed in blog posts. Note that the “relevant topics” lists are subject to change and posts may be added, removed, or combined as the blog evolves.
</p>
<h2>
Freshman Year: Personal Projects and Research
</h2>
<p>
You have no job history when you start out and you need to get your first job without prior work experience. This the hardest obstacle to overcome because many positions require that you have prior work experience. At this early stage, you’ll want to “manufacture” experience from personal projects and from doing free or low-paid research for a professor. Personal projects and cheap research have a low barrier for entry. Your freshman year can be devoted to getting your first work experience anywhere; after this year, the journey becomes much easier.
</p>
<h3>
Goals
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Complete some personal projects</li>
	<li>Do research with a professor during the school year or summer</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Relevant Topics
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="personal-projects-first-internship.html">
      Why you should work on personal projects
    </a>
  </li>
	<li>How to complete a solid personal project</li>
	<li>Resumes</li>
	<li>Behavioral interviewing</li>
	<li>Research opportunities</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Sophomore Year: First Legitimate Internship
</h2>
<p>
Once you have experiences you can talk about, you’ll have a successful time applying for internships at companies. In your sophomore year, you’ll want to practice approaching recruiters at job fairs and working through technical interviews. You’ll also want to build up your network and get to know people working at reputable companies. The goal is to get a paid internship at any company and to set up for your junior year, which is arguably the most-important year.
</p>
<h3>
Goals
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Meet many companies and recruiters</li>
	<li>Get comfortable with technical interviews</li>
	<li>Get an internship</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Relevant topics
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Researching companies beforehand</li>
	<li>Career fair and initial job applications</li>
	<li>Emailing recruiters properly</li>
	<li>Networking</li>
	<li>Technical interviewing</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Junior Year: Getting a Highly-Desired Internship
</h2>
<p>
Your junior year internship will have the greatest influence on where you end up full-time. In your junior year, you should seek out internships at large, big-name companies like Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, or Google. These are the places where everyone wants to intern. They are highly sought after because not only do the positions pay well, but they are recognized anywhere you go. In any subsequent interview, having a brand like “Facebook” on your resume is a much more beneficial than “Random Company from the Middle of Nowhere.” Furthermore, if you get a return offer from one of these firms, it will be very competitive and serves as leverage when you seek out a full-time offer your senior year.
</p>
<h3>
Goals
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Get an internship at a big-name company</li>
	<li>Get a return offer after your internship</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Relevant topics
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Deciding between internship companies</li>
	<li>Making the most of your internship</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Senior Year: the Full-time Job Search
</h2>
<p>
Finally, senior year will come along and your experiences from the past three years will enable you to obtain a competitive offer for a full-time job. If you performed well during your junior-year internship, you’ll have a return offer. You can continue interviewing at more firms to get more offers. If you do get multiple acceptances, you’ll have the opportunity to negotiate. Above all, you should not make the mistake of accepting whichever package is larger, but rather accept the offer at the firm that will help you grow the most. At this point, you’ll be ready to go off into the “real” world!
</p>
<h3>
Goals
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Get several full-time job offers</li>
	<li>Negotiate and get the best package from the best company</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Relevant topics
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Negotiating</li>
	<li>Deciding between full-time companies</li>
	<li>Staying a fifth year</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Not a One-Size-Fits-All
</h2>
<p>
This is not meant to be a strict checklist of things to accomplish, but rather a general outline. Factors like pre-college experiences, nepotism, and other special cases will definitely affect the choices you make and you’ll certainly want to take advantage of the circumstances from which you benefit. In my opinion, the above sequence of actions serves as a decent template for someone who is unsure of what to do. Certain parts will be relevant to your situation, but you definitely do not have to follow the timeline exactly.
