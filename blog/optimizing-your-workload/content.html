College is a long endeavour and it’s important not to burn out. By taking on an appropriate workload and scheduling classes at the right times, you can make your life more manageable. Optimizing your workload can make the difference between As and Bs and between being happy and being miserable.

<h2>
The Importance of Mental Wellbeing
</h2>
<p>
I spent three years, or six semesters, in college and during the semesters when I felt the least stressed, I had the best grades. Hopefully that makes logical sense: when you do well academically, you feel better mentally, and when you feel better mentally, you have more motivation to do well academically. When the cycle compounds, you end the semester with a fantastic finish.
</p>
<p>
The number of courses you take and when you choose to take them has a strong impact on your mental wellbeing and class performance. For example, I overloaded my second year of college, anticipating the workload would not be difficult, but I ended up with more than I bargained for; consequently, my grades and mental wellbeing took some damage.
</p>
<h3>
The Semester When My Mental Wellbeing Suffered
</h3>
<p>
In the Fall semester of my second year, I made the terrible choice of stacking all my lectures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, thinking I could easily get the work done on my class-free Tuesdays and Thursdays (and I had another 10-hour weekly extracurricular commitment as well). On Mondays and Wednesdays, I’d get up at 8:00AM and return at 5:00PM after four 90-minute lectures all day long (plus lunch and bus rides from class to class). On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I’d be reviewing lectures or struggling with projects and homework because I couldn’t digest 360 minutes of continuous material. I was running a marathon by sprinting it a mile at a time; after fifteen miles, I needed longer and longer breaks, which I didn’t have.
</p>
<p>
By the final few weeks of the semester, I burned out and was mentally drained. I had maintained an absolute A (at least 93%) in every class, but started falling asleep in lecture and lost the motivation to study. The fact that the hardest material comes at the end of a course further exacerbated the situation. For the first time, I no longer had the willpower to spend extra time to learn all the concepts well. I took my finals, and was not confident in my answers. I received well-deserved 60s and 70s on my exams. For the tougher classes like cryptography or combinatorics, I barely escaped thanks to a generous grading curve. For other classes like computer architecture, I paid for my mistake in GPA. From then on, I made sure to build reasonable schedules, no matter how enticing class-free Tuesdays and Thursdays seemed.
</p>
<h2>
Building a Schedule with Your Wellbeing in Mind
</h2>
<p>
Building an optimized course schedule is like budgeting money and both require lots of preparation and attention to detail. You have a fixed amount of effort that you can use pay for each class. Furthermore, not everyone can afford the same amount of effort, so there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Finally, taking classes at the right times can come with discounts. Accounting for all these variables ahead of registration dates and preparing several backup schedules enables you to fully optimize your workload.
</p>
<h3>
Determine your Maximum Effort
</h3>
<p>
The first step to building an optimized workload is to determine how much work you can handle. It’s hard to quantify such a subjective attribute though and I don’t have any formulas, but I do have some advice on getting a baseline to reference. In your first semester of college, you should be conservative and take a light courseload - let’s say 80% of a “normal” courseload that your school recommends. At the end of the semester, you can reflect on how hard that was. Were you getting As while playing video games all the time or were you getting Cs while studying late into the night? Then, you can adjust credits up or down to get a baseline maximum amount of work that you can handle. If the baseline is off during the next semester, you can continue adjusting it. Everyone’s baseline will be different though and just because your friend can work for 100 hours a week, doesn’t mean you can. Make sure you don’t overestimate your abilities.
</p>
<p>
Once you determine your baseline maximum amount of credits that you can take, you can start picking classes. Just make sure to stick to your budget and allocate classes accordingly. When choosing classes, in addition to looking at the number of credits the course guide states, you should apply two modifiers that are discussed next. 
</p>
<h3>
Marking Up Effort when you Take Many Classes on a Given Day
</h3>
<p>
The number of classes you squeeze into a given day affects how much effort is required. As a simple example, taking two classes every day, Monday to Friday, is pretty manageable, but taking all ten classes on Monday is not. Halfway through Monday, you’d be too tired and unable to pay full attention anymore. Yes, you’d have four additional days to relearn the material, but then you’ve wasted your lecture time. When you catch up in the remaining four days, you’re spending extra time learning the same material you spent lecture time on. Furthermore, your professor can teach you better than you can teach yourself in the same time, so missing pieces of lecture is also very inefficient. When you stack all your classes onto certain days, you’re hurting your efficiency; when you evenly distribute your classes across the week, you’re pacing yourself to maximize efficiency.
</p>
<p>
My overloaded Fall semester is an example of when an uneven distribution of classes requires extra effort. I couldn’t pay full attention to 360 minutes of lecture every Monday and Wednesday so I resorted to catching up on Tuesdays and Thursday. I’d already wasted lecture time failing to learn the material because I was tired. In addition, catching up on lecture outside of class combined with doing homework and projects further drained my mental willpower. The drained mental power would then cause me to be even more tired in lecture. And the vicious cycle repeated, causing me do poorly on my final exams. My poor scheduling choices aggravated the negative outcomes from taking a workload greater than I could handle.
</p>
<p>
How cluttered your days are has an effect on how hard it will be to pay attention in lecture. Although your classes may be x credits in total, it can be x+ credits if you take too many classes on the same day. You should mark up the total number of credits you’re taking if you’re scheduling too many classes on the same days.
</p>
<h3>
Discounting Effort when you Take Classes At the Right Time
</h3>
<p>
The time at which you take a class also has a huge impact on how much effort is required. As a simple example, it is much easier to pay attention at 10AM than at 4AM (unless your sleep schedule has already shifted to the point of no return). This suggests that taking a class at an optimal time during the day takes less effort. Personally, my optimal hours were 10AM - 12 noon and 2PM - 3PM so I made sure to schedule the majority of my classes around those times. I almost never scheduled classes before 9AM or after 4PM. When you schedule classes around your optimal working hours, you automatically pay attention more-easily and so you can discount the amount of mental effort that each class costs. Of course, the amount by which you can discount varies from person to person, and you will need to use your first semester to get a reference point.
</p>
<p>
My overloaded Fall semester serves as an example of the benefits of scheduling courses during optimal working hours. I took twice the number of recommended technical courses, which was very stressful in general. Fortunately, the lectures were scheduled close to my optimal working hours. My earliest class was at 9AM and my latest class ended at 4:30PM and I was usually awake and paying attention. As I became mentally drained while the semester dragged on, the optimal time window shrank and I struggled to process lecture material. After that semester, I realized that had my classes been shifted an hour earlier or an hour later, my performance would have been drastically worse starting from a much earlier date.
</p>
<p>
The time at which you take a class has a huge effect on how hard it will be to pay attention and digest material. Although a class may be x credits, it can be x- credits if you take it at the right time and x+ credits if you take it at the wrong time. You should increase or decrease the amount of effort required for courses based on how close they’re scheduled to your optimal working hours. 
</p>
<h3>
Scheduling and Registering For Courses
</h3>
<p>
Normally, what happens is you build a schedule, but when your registration date comes along, the lecture times you want are no longer available. Registration can be a pain when you can’t get into the classes you want. Consequently you should select several different sets of courses that you are willing to take and create several different optimized schedules. As you watch lecture times fill up, you can adjust or create new schedules as appropriate. When it's time to register, hopefully you’ll still have one schedule that works. As annoying as this sounds, investing a few hours to optimize your class performance is definitely worth it.

Class Hacks

<p>
Unfortunately, you might run into a situation where you don’t get a fully-optimal schedule. There are several class hacks that I’ll discuss in a later post.

Summary
</h2>
<p>
This post discussed how courseload and lecture times can affect your performance, either for better or for worse. You can optimize your class performance by taking the correct amount of courses at the correct times. Everyone has different “correct amounts” and “correct times,” so it will take some experimenting. Although the optimization costs a bit of upfront effort, it pays huge dividends in the long run.
