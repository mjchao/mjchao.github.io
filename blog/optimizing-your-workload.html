College is a long endeavour and it’s important not to burn out. By taking on an appropriate workload and scheduling classes at the right times, you make your life more manageable. Optimizing your workload makes the difference between As and Bs and between being happy and being miserable.
</p>
<h2>
The Importance of Mental Wellbeing
</h2>
<p>
During the semesters when I felt the least stressed, I had the best grades. Hopefully that makes logical sense: when you do well academically, you feel better mentally, and when you feel better mentally, you have more motivation to do well academically. When the cycle compounds, you end the semester with a fantastic finish.
</p>
<p>
The number of courses you take and when you choose to take them has a strong impact on your mental wellbeing and class performance. For example, I overloaded my second Fall term of college, anticipating the workload would not be difficult. The workload turned out harder than I expected and my grades and mental wellbeing took some damage.
</p>
<h3>
The Semester When My Mental Wellbeing Suffered
</h3>
<p>
In the Fall semester of my second year, I made the terrible choice of stacking four difficult and technical lectures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, thinking I could easily get the work done on my class-free Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I’d get up at 8:00AM and return at 5:00PM after four 90-minute lectures all day long (plus lunch and bus rides from class to class). On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I’d be reviewing lectures or struggling with projects and homework because I couldn’t digest 360 minutes of continuous material. I was running a marathon by sprinting it a mile at a time; after fifteen miles, I needed longer and longer breaks, which I didn’t have.
</p>
<p>
By the final few weeks of the semester, I burned out and was mentally drained. I no longer had the willpower to spend extra time learning lecture concepts well. I took my finals, and was not confident in my answers. I received well-deserved 60s and 70s on my exams. I was thankful that the grading curve saved me. My semester became unmanageable because I had taken too many hard courses and scheduled them all on the same days of the week.
</p>
<h2>
Building a Schedule That Won’t Burn You Out
</h2>
<p>
Building an optimized course schedule is like budgeting money and both require lots of preparation and attention to detail. You have a fixed amount of effort that you can use to pay for each class, and taking classes at the right times can come with discounts. Accounting for these variables helps you optimize for a workload that doesn’t burn you out.
</p>
<h3>
Determine Your Maximum Effort
</h3>
<p>
The first step to building an optimized workload is to determine how much work you can handle. In your first semester of college, you should be conservative and take a light courseload - let’s say 80% of a “normal” courseload that your school recommends. At the end of the semester, you can reflect on how hard that was. Were you getting As while playing video games all the time or were you getting Cs while studying late into the night? Then, you can adjust credits up or down to get a baseline maximum amount of work that you can handle. If the baseline seems off during the next semester, you can continue adjusting it.
</p>
<p>
Once you have your baseline maximum amount of credits that you can take, you can pick a suitable number of classes. When choosing classes, in addition to looking at the number of credits the course guide states, you should apply two modifiers that are discussed next. 
</p>
<h3>
 Marking Up Effort When You Take Many Classes on a Given Day
</h3>
<p>
The number of classes you squeeze into a given day affects how much effort is required. As a simple example, taking two classes every day, Monday to Friday, is pretty manageable. However, taking all ten classes on Monday is not because halfway through Monday, you’d be too tired and unable to pay full attention anymore. Yes, you’d have four additional days to relearn the material, but then you’ve wasted your lecture time. When you catch up in the remaining four days, you’re spending extra time learning the same material you spent lecture time on. This is a large inefficiency that you avoid by evenly distributing classes over school days.
</p>
<p>
When you stack all your classes onto certain days, you’re hurting your efficiency; when you evenly distribute your classes across the week, you’re pacing yourself correctly. Although your classes may be x credits each, they can all become x+ credits if you take too many of them on the same day. You should mark up the total number of credits you’re taking if you’re scheduling too many classes on the same days.
</p>
<h3>
Discounting Effort When You Take Classes at the Right Time
</h3>
<p>
The time at which you take a class also has a huge impact on how much effort is required. As a simple example, it is much easier to pay attention at 10AM than at 3AM (unless your sleep schedule has already shifted to the point of no return). This suggests that taking a class at an optimal time during the day takes less effort. Personally, my optimal hours were 10AM - 12 noon and 2PM - 3PM so I made sure to schedule the majority of my classes around those times. I almost never scheduled classes before 9AM or after 4PM.
</p>
<p>
The time at which you take a class has a huge effect on how hard it will be to pay attention and digest material. Although a class may be x credits, it can be x- credits if you take it when you are normally alert and awake. On the other hand, it can be x+ credits if you take it when you normally feel sleepy. You should slightly increase or decrease the amount of effort required for courses based on how close they’re scheduled to your optimal working hours. 
</p>
<h3>
Scheduling and Registering For Courses
</h3>
<p>
Once you’ve picked an appropriate set of classes with the modifiers discussed previously, you wait until your registration date comes along to enroll in those classes. Normally, when it’s your turn to register, the lecture times you want are no longer available. Registration can be a pain when you can’t get into the classes you want. Consequently you should select several different sets of courses that you are willing to take and create several different optimized schedules. As you watch lecture times fill up, you can adjust or create new schedules as appropriate. When it’s time to register, hopefully you’ll have one schedule that still works. As annoying as this sounds, investing a few hours to optimize your class performance is definitely worth it.
</p>
<h3>
Class Hacks
</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, you might run into a situation where you don’t get a fully-optimal schedule. There are several class hacks that I’ll discuss in a later post.
</p>
<h2>
Summary
</h2>
<p>
This post discussed how courseload and lecture times can affect your performance, either for better or for worse. You can optimize your class performance by taking the correct amount of courses at the correct times. Everyone has different “correct amounts” and “correct times,” so it will take some experimenting. Although the optimization costs a bit of upfront effort, it pays huge dividends in the long run.
