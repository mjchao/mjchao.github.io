Class full? Not a problem. As computer science departments grow more and more understaffed, getting into classes gets harder and harder. Class registration is a pain when the courses you want to take are all full. But just because it’s full doesn’t mean there’s no hope left. First, we’ll look at why classes are over-enrolled, but have empty seats by the end of the semester. Then, we’ll look at ways to optimize getting those empty seats and getting into the classes you want. 
</p>
<h2>
Causes of Over-Enrollment
</h2>
<p>
The primary reason classes get overenrolled is that students with earlier registration dates sign up for classes they end up dropping and cause a domino effect that spreads to everyone else. Suppose students A, B, and C register in that order. Student A takes the last spot in one of student B’s classes. Student B joins the waitlist, but to ensure s/he graduates on time, student B registers for another class and takes away student C’s spot. And the chain goes on.
</p>
<p>
One week into the semester, student A decides to drop the class. Student B gets off the waitlist so s/he drops student C’s class and enrolls in the class that student A dropped. And the chain goes on. It can take a day for each student to manually update their schedule in the system after getting off the waitlist, so some registration chains can go on for a week. By the time it’s student Z’s turn to get off the waitlist, it’s already been two weeks into the semester. There’s no way student Z can catch up on two weeks of material, so s/he does not enroll in the class and the spot goes to waste.
</p>
<p>
Class registration is a hugely-inefficient process with problematic ethics. Some people drop their classes because they got lazy or weren’t planning on taking it in the first place. This causes the majority of the registration inefficiencies and I find it unethical, but there’s little anyone can do about it. On the bright side, there will almost always be a spot for you later in the semester. This post will describe 3 ethical tips and 3 unethical (but 100% legal) hacks to maximize your chances of getting into your class and without falling behind on lecture.
</p>
<h2>
Tip #1: Join Early and Stay on the Waitlist
</h2>
<p>
The waitlist is the standard way to sign up for a class that’s full. Always be sure to join the waitlist as early as possible. Have whatever online form you use to join the waitlist filled out a few minutes before your registration time and as soon as it’s time to register, you should submit it. You’ll get in front of others who fill out their form during the registration time.
</p>
<p>
Because waitlists are the standard way of getting into full classes, it’s important you stay on for as long as possible. Since everyone takes advantage of the waitlist, there will be a lot of people ahead of you, but a many of them may not be serious about taking the class. There’s usually no limit on the number of classes you can waitlist for, so a lot of times, people join a ton of different waitlists and they can’t possibly take all those classes. When these people get off the waitlist, they might not join the class and you’ll move through the waitlist much faster than expected. The instructors might also open up a new lecture if the class was more popular than predicted. You never know what will happen to the people in front of you on the waitlist, so never give up.
</p>
<h2>
Tip #2: Watch Full Classes
</h2>
<p>
If you’re aiming to get into a class with a short waitlist capacity or one with no waitlist at all, you’ll want to watch it carefully. Sometimes, there’s a glitch in the system and the waitlist is unavailable, or maybe the class just has a small waitlist capacity, or maybe nobody’s waitlisted it yet. In those cases, as soon as someone drops the class, you may just be able to snipe that spot and get in. You should repeatedly check the class enrollment whenever you’re free. It’ll be worth the effort if you get in.
</p>
<h2>
Tip #3: Email or Talk with the Professor
</h2>
<p>
Professors sometimes might have control over the waitlists. If you meet with the professor and tell him/her about your circumstances, there’s a chance they might accommodate you. For example, if you’re studying abroad next year and don’t have another chance to take the class, that’s a perfect special circumstance the professor could consider (if you’re unethical, you could also make up a special circumstance). You might also get some information about the waitlist, such as your chances of getting into the class. There’s nothing to lose and you’ll get to know the professor a bit better too.
</p>
<h2>
Hack #4: Register for A Lecture Time You Won’t Go To
</h2>
<p>
Here is the first unethical hack and it applies when there are multiple lecture times. Often, a class will have two (or more) sections: one at convenient time T and one at inconvenient time U. Time T is full and time U has open spots, but time U doesn’t work well for you. You can simply register for time U and go during time T. Similarly, if times T and U are both full, the waitlist for T tends to be longer than U, so join the waitlist for time U.
</p>
<p>
If there aren’t lecture-specific assignments, this hack works perfectly. If there are lecture-specific assignments like papers, you could try turning in your work for time U during time T. If you have pop-quizzes, there will be a space for you to write your lecture time, and you can simply write U even if you’re attending during time T. The unethical aspect is you’ll be taking a seat from someone who is officially registered for time T; however, you don’t have to feel as bad because halfway through the semester, plenty of other unethical people will drop the class out of laziness and there will be enough seats again.
</p>
<h2>
Hack #5: Go to the Lecture Anyways
</h2>
<p>
You can also just go to the lecture even if you’re still on the waitlist - nobody is checking your registration status! Some person is bound to drop the class late in the semester so if you stay on the waitlist and just keep going to the class and doing all the work, you’ll get your spot. Like in the previous method, nobody will have you thrown out of class, but you are taking a seat that belongs to someone else.
</p>
<p>
I personally did this once when I was at waitlist spot 70 for a class of size 120. Since there was a lot of difficult math in this computer science class, I anticipated a flood of people would be too lazy to keep up, and I got off the waitlist after around two weeks. At the start of the semester, people were standing, and by the midterm exam, there were empty chairs. I admit I took a seat that I was not entitled to, but I made full use of that chair - the people who dropped the class were the ones who stole opportunities that others could’ve used. Had I followed the normal waitlist rules by not going to lecture since there were not enough seats, I would not have been able to catch up when I officially got in after two weeks. Normally, I wouldn’t have taken this course of action, but my upcoming internship depended on this material and there was no alternative for me.
</p>
<h2>
Hack #6: “The System Won’t Let Me Register”
</h2>
<p>
I’ll finish with a novel hack: complaining that the system won’t let you waitlist for a class. You can’t do this every semester, but in dire situations, there are a variety of excuses you can make. Here’s an example when the course you want to take has a prerequisite that can be met by course X or Y and you have prerequisite Y: you email the scheduling office saying you don’t have prerequisite X (don’t mention Y), but you feel you have the necessary background in X to take the course. You ask the scheduler if s/he can let you into the course and then hope the scheduler doesn’t look at your course history and realize you have the prerequisites. If all goes well, the scheduler will override the system and let you enroll in the class.
</p>
<p>
This hack is feasible because the scheduling office can let you bypass the waitlist and get into the class. The feature is primarily used to take people off the waitlist and let them enroll. It can also be used to let those without the proper prerequisites in. However, there won’t be an override feature to insert you on the waitlist. To take advantage of this, you come up with any believable excuse about why the system won’t let you waitlist the class. Then, the office will have to let you bypass the waitlist. This works well if your scheduler is one of the “I couldn’t care less” types. If the scheduler corrects you, and says, “Oh you have prerequisite Y, you’re fine!” then better luck next time.
</p>
<h2>
Summary
</h2>
<p>
Class registration gets pretty inefficient due to people registering for classes and then dropping them several days into the semester. There will almost certainly be a spot for you eventually, so you want to maximize your chances of getting that spot and still being up-to-date with the lecture material. The first three tips help you get off the waitlist. The next two hacks help you stay caught up with lecture material. And the final hack is a bit of a desperate attempt to get into an excessively-waitlisted class when you don’t think you have a chance.
