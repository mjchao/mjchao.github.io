Your full-time job will be more than just a paycheck: you should also factor in if you’ll enjoy life outside of work. Is the weather bearable? Will there be like-minded people around you? Do you have faith in the local government? Is the cost of living worth it? Can you have fun living there? We’ll first look at quality of life, and then we’ll dedicate the remainder and majority of the post to the best part: how to have fun during the internship.
</p>
<h2>
Quality of Life
</h2>
<p>
Good quality of life means you’ll be happier, less stressed and perform better at your job. If you perform better at your job, you’ll get promoted, earn more, have an even happier life, and the cycle repeats. The opposite is also true: having poor quality of life means you’ll be more unhappy and stressed, perform worse at your job, get warnings about your job performance and become even more unhappy and stressed. That’s why when deciding if you should commit to your intern company full-time, it’s important to ensure you will be happy living wherever your intern company is located.
</p>
<p>
Let’s briefly go over some important questions:
</p>
<p>
<b>Is the weather bearable?</b> Weather can have a major impact on your mood and everyone has different preferences. Are you enjoying the summer weather where you’re interning? And research or ask around about what the weather is like during the other seasons.
</p>
<p>
<b>Do you have faith in the local government?</b> Do some research on your local leaders and make sure you support or can at least tolerate their policies.Your local government regulates many aspects of your life: taxes, public transit, parks, recreational drugs, zoning laws, and so on. 
</p>
<p>
<b>What are the wealth demographics like?</b> Quality of life is usually better in wealthier areas, whereas poorer areas suffer from disinvestment and violence. Explore the area around you and see if it gives off a wealthy or poor impression. And if it’s not safe to explore, then you probably want to avoid that area for your full-time job.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is the cost of living worth it?</b> Consider if you are overpaying for quality of life though. If you can barely afford rent with your intern salary, then even if the location has all the amenities you want, your rent payments will definitely stress you if you go there full-time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Are there fun things to do?</b> Most importantly, does the area have activities that would be fun for someone in their 20s when they start their full-time job? Everyone’s preference varies, but consider these: restaurants, bars, dance clubs, comedy clubs, parks, theaters, and gyms.
</p>
<h2>
Having Fun
</h2>
<p>
Your internship is one of the ideal times to have fun. While you had homework and projects to do in school, you have no evening or weekend responsibilities after work during your internship. Finding fun things to do can be daunting during an internship though. For example, during my first internship, everyone I knew went out of town for Fourth of July and I stayed in my apartment for most of it. Don’t end up like me!
</p>
<h3>
Making New Friends
</h3>
<p>
Friends are what lead to fun weekend activities; a group can usually come up with more and better ideas than any individual. Alice says she knows a fun karaoke place. Bob brings up a restaurant he’s been dying to try out. And Carl has a car and can drive people to a laser tag arena that is otherwise inaccessible via public transit. The more people you know, the more the opportunities open up.
</p>
<p>
Internships are a great opportunity to make new friendships. Most interns are entering a completely new environment where they don’t know many people and are open to befriending others. If you want to dive right into the deep end of the pool, here’s an intern community that my college friend started: <a href="https://intern.club/">Intern Club</a>. You’ll be able to connect with thousands of interns, many of whom are in your area and in the same boat as you: looking for people to hang out with.
</p>
<p>
If you don’t feel comfortable diving into such a large community, you can start small with the interns at your company and acquaintances from college who are also working in the same location. Within the first week of your internship, consider hosting a gathering at your apartment and invite other interns at your company or people from college. You just have to buy some snacks, alcohol if you’re of age, and get a few board games. <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com">Jackbox games</a> are a quick and easy way to get a game going on the TV and everyone can join on their mobile device’s browser. During the houseparty, you can talk about activities to do over the summer and that’ll help set up your future weekends!
</p>
<h3>
Fun Outside Activities
</h3>
<p>
Assuming your internship location is a populated area, here are some fun activities you can do outside your house with others and don’t involve alcohol:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Museums</li>
	<li>Concerts</li>
	<li>Hiking or picnics at state and national parks</li>
	<li>Food festivals</li>
	<li>Beaches</li>
	<li>Comedy clubs</li>
	<li>Exploring nearby neighborhoods</li>
	<li>Visiting other companies’ campuses (without trespassing)</li>
	<li>Visiting nearby college campuses</li>
	<li>Shopping malls</li>
	<li>Movie theaters</li>
	<li>Escape rooms</li>
	<li>Go karting</li>
	<li>Amusement parks</li>
	<li>Sporting events</li>
	<li>Social dancing</li>
</ul>
<p>
And of course, eating out at restaurants is always an option. If you must have alcohol and are of age, bars and clubs are there. If your internship is in a big city, there will be plenty of unique restaurants, creative cocktails, fine wines and spirits, and excellent beers to try.
</p>
<h2>
Fun Indoor Activities
</h2>
<p>
If the weather isn’t great or people aren’t feeling like going outdoors, here are some indoor activities you can do with others:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Board and card games</li>
	<li>Movies and TV shows</li>
	<li>Cooking</li>
	<li>Learning art or an instrument</li>
	<li>Makeshift karaoke in someone’s apartment</li>
	<li>Low-stakes poker or other gambling, if people are into that</li>
</ul>
<p>
Or you can just have a low-key hangout at someone’s apartment and talk about random things.
</p>
<h3>
Meetup
</h3>
<p>
If you really aren’t able to get anything going with other interns, you can try <a href="https://www.meetup.com">Meetup</a>. The people there are likely to be older and may not share the same interests and background as you, but at least you’ll have some way to spend your weekend.
</p>
<h3>
Company Activities
</h3>
<p>
Finally, take full advantage of activities organized by your company. During my internships, I took advantage of boat cruises, amusement parks, happy hours, bubble soccer, archery tag, water tubing, and more. As an intern mentor, I’ve also organized events such as card games or Fourth of July volleyball at the beach (so that no intern has to spend Fourth of July like I did). Don’t pass on opportunities organized by your company! They are a welcoming and fun way to meet others at your firm.
</p>
<h3>
Did You Have Fun?
</h3>
<p>
Did you have fun during your internship? Depending on your preferences, how much fun you had may (and should) factor into your evaluation of your internship company. Fun was definitely a big factor in my full-time decision. During my freshman summer, I interned at my current employer, Jump Trading. I had some fun activity pretty much every week, whether it be organized by the company or with the other interns I befriended. When I saw many of the people I had fun with returning to the company full-time, that was a strong signal for me. I strongly advise you do not overlook the fun factor during your internship.
</p>
<h2>
Summary
</h2>
<p>
Life outside your internship work is just as important as your internship project. Your internship summer is a great opportunity to judge the city, town, village, or other community where the company is located. Make sure the surrounding environment is compatible with your preferences, whether it be weather, local government, or more importantly, fun. Take your internship as an opportunity to make new friends and enjoy yourself!
