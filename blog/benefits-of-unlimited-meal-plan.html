      <p>
A lot of people decide not to get meal plans because they seem overpriced. If your college has dining halls that offer an unlimited meal plan, you may want to consider purchasing it. Using an unlimited meal plan every day may not be as expensive and overpriced as it seems when compared to cooking.
</p>
<h2>
The Cost of an Unlimited Meal Plan
</h2>
<p>
My college offered an unlimited meal plan that was decently priced assuming I used it for every meal. It cost me $4,000 for two semesters, or 30 weeks of school. Averaged over 210 days, that’s approximately $20 per day. Your prices may vary, but I don’t expect them to be too far off. So you should ask yourself if you’d pay $20 a day to eat as much as you’d like and be able to select from a wide variety of options. I definitely think that’s worth it and let’s analyze the alternative of cooking your own food.
</p>
<h2>
The Inefficiencies of Cooking Your Own Food
</h2>
<p>
If you don’t buy a meal plan, the cost effective alternative is cooking your own food, and that has its own set of hassles. You can’t eat out because you’ll easily surpass $20 a day ordering takeout from restaurants. Considering cooking, we should look at the cost of a meal. I cook after I get home from work. A typical dinner I make consists of pasta, onions, tomatoes, kale, turkey, and cheese. The deli turkey meat costs around $1.50 for a quarter pound. A quarter of an onion is around $0.25. A small tomato costs $1.00. A cup of kale costs around $0.25. And a handful of cheese is around $0.50. In all, my dinner costs around $3.50. Extending this to three meals, you’ll probably eat around $10.00 of raw ingredients per day.
</p>
<p>
It costs only $20 per day for an unlimited meal plan, and in my opinion, the $10 difference is not worth your time and effort spent cooking. Ideally, you’d cook fresh food each day to avoid eating spoiled food and getting food poisoning. You have to wash and cut your vegetables, cook them, and then clean your dishes, pots, and pans afterwards. These hassles can take an hour out of your day over the course of three meals.
</p>
<h3>
Are the Savings Worth It?
</h3>
<p>
You’re essentially saving $10 each day by cooking/cleaning for an hour and eating lower-quality food than at the dining hall. Over the course of 210 days in the semester, you’ll have saved $2,100. That’s a pretty decent amount. Note that if you occasionally eat out or order takeout, the savings are even less.
</p>
<p>
$2,100 is a lot of money, but you can get an even better rate working a real job elsewhere. For example, the dining halls in my college paid a rate of $11/hour and even gave you a free meal after your shift. In my computer science department, an instructional aide could earn $25/hour and research assistants probably earned at least $15/hour. I’ve tutored people for $20/hour and there are many jobs that pay better AND can go on your resume.
</p>
<h3>
Other Aspects to Consider
</h3>
<p>
There are additional smaller things to consider. For example, you need transportation to the grocery store and maintaining a car and renting a parking spot can be costly. There are also days when you are swamped with homework and projects. It’s not worth $10 if you’re starving and can’t focus on your schoolwork.
</p>
<h3>
Cheap Unhealthy Crap Is Not An Option
</h3>
<p>
As a side note, eating cheap, crappy food is not an option you should consider because you’re simply borrowing money from your future self. For example, you can eat a $1 frozen pizza for every meal. If you save a few thousand dollars now by eating crappy food, you’ll pay it all back (plus much more) in medical bills during your later years of life. Furthermore, in a later blog post, I’ll explain how eating poorly negatively impacts your studies. Not only are you borrowing from your future health, but you are borrowing from your class performance and indirectly wasting college tuition when you eat shitty food.
</p>
<h2>
You’ll Eat Much Better in the Dining Hall
</h2>
<p>
Now, let’s look at the benefits of an unlimited meal plan. One huge aspect in which an unlimited meal plan beats cooking at home is that the dining hall offers quality foods that are too expensive for you to buy as an individual with a budget of $3/meal. For breakfast, I used to eat tons of fruit in the dining hall that alone would exceed $3 at the grocery store. I’d be eating out-of-season fruits like blueberries, sliced pineapple, and melons every morning and a single bowl could sell for over $3 at the grocery store. Of course, it doesn’t cost the dining hall $3 because it buys in bulk - a win-win situation for both of us.
</p>
<p>
For lunch and dinner, I’d pick out the quality meats like salmon and eat several plates. There’s no way you’re getting a pound of salmon at the grocery store for $3. I’d also eat a salad every day with seven different vegetables. There’s no way you can obtain such variety for a salad on a $3/meal budget. Finally, I’d eat four meals a day: breakfast, lunch, 5pm dinner, and 8pm dinner right before the dining hall closed. I was very happy and eating well, so $20/day was definitely a bargain for me.
</p>
<h2>
Misconceptions of the Unlimited Meal Plan
</h2>
<p>
For post-school life, I agree with the common conception that cooking is better than paying for your meals; however, college is not a direct analogy to “real life.” In college, you’re usually working more than 40 hours a week and have projects, homework, and extracurriculars to do in the evenings. When you just work 8 hours a day for a full-time job, you have plenty of free time after work to cook. That benefit is nonexistent in college. Also, in real life, you tend to cook for a family. If you have a family of four, it’s clearly a savings when one person spends one hour cooking for four people and saves $40 ($10 each for four people); however, a single college student saving $10/hour just for him/herself is not as great.
</p>
<p>
A lot of negativity towards unlimited meal plans also comes from people who don’t use them properly. Eating hamburgers, french fries and pizza for every meal is clearly not worth $20/day and those people subsidized my meals. Sleeping in and skipping meals is also pretty dumb. Furthermore, ordering food because you missed the dining hall hours of operation is even dumber. These are all silly choices I’ve seen people with unlimited meal plans make and they unfairly contribute to the hostility towards unlimited meal plans.
</p>
<h2>
Summary
</h2>
<p>
Cooking at home in college can save you money, but not as much as you think. Using an unlimited meal plan correctly can be much more effective because it frees up your time that could be spent on studying or working in a paid position. The unlimited meal plan also enables you to eat healthier, and can even turn out to be a big discount. Most of the incorrect negativity towards unlimited meal plans stems from unrealistic analogies to real-life and from improper usage of the meal plan.
