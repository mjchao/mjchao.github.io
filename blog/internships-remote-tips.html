Covid19 has changed the world completely and most people, including interns, are in a work-from-home setup now. In the past four internship posts, we talked about how to excel and make the most of your internship during normal times. In this post, we’ll review everything we discussed previously and provide remote setup tips for each aspect.
</p>
<h2>
Part 1: Working Towards the Return Offer
</h2>
<p>
In part one of the internship series, we looked at how to work towards the return offer by demonstrating your technical ability, personality, and work ethic.
</p>
<h3>
Technical Ability
</h3>
<p>
For technical ability, coding remotely is similar to coding in the office: you write your code independently. When questions arise, consider if you want to send a text message or start a video chat with your mentor. Simple questions are efficient to resolve via text, while complex questions are better discussed over video chat. Consider looking for online whiteboard software because pictures are much more expressive than words. For example, Zoom has a whiteboard feature that you can use with a tablet device and stylus for drawing. In the absolute worst case, you can share your screen and draw with your mouse on Microsoft Paint. For the most part, coding is the same as before, and long discussions can easily be augmented with virtual whiteboards.
</p>
<h3>
Personality
</h3>
<p>
Personality is influenced by a remote setup because people will form their impression of you through what they see and hear during virtual meetings. Here are some tips for your at-home setup:
</p>
<p>
<b>Test your audio.</b> Make sure you hear yourself speaking loud enough. If you sit too far away from the computer microphone, people may not be able to hear you. They may incorrectly assume you are quiet.
</p>
<p>
<b>Check your video.</b> Check yourself in the video before joining a meeting. People will see you close up in a video and for example, you don’t want people to see the food stuck in your teeth from lunch.
</p>
<p>
<b>Check your background.</b> Make sure your background is safe for work and looks mature. Remove any questionable decorations: for example, the painting you made in first grade, or that photo of middle school you acting like a clown. Consider replacing them with books or mature artwork.
</p>
<p>
<b>Close the door to your room.</b> Make sure pets and other distractions don’t enter during work hours and derail a meeting. If you do have cute pets, feel free to introduce them to your coworkers during a meet-and-greet session at the start of the internship.
</p>
<p>
<b>Keep the windows shut and curtains drawn.</b> Shut your windows to block outside noise. Keep the curtains drawn so that your camera has natural lighting and turn on the lights if your face appears too dark in the video.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dress slightly better than your full-time coworkers.</b> Although you’re working from home, it’s not an excuse to throw on sweatpants or a ten year old T-shirt. Dress as if you were in the office and dress slightly better than your coworkers - but not too much. Being slightly more presentable gives off a professional vibe. Most importantly, keep your pants on at all times to avoid accidents where you thought your camera was off.
</p>
<h3>
Work Ethic
</h3>
<p>
Remember that a key part of demonstrating a strong work ethic involves appearing to work long hours. Although you can’t physically be in the office to show people you’re working long hours, you can add some git commits or edit some shared documents during off  hours and other people will see the timestamps. You also don’t have to be at your computer the entire time; if you finish early, you can step out in the middle of the day and commit your code later. This will give the impression that you’re taking your work seriously even if it’s too easy for you.
</p>
<p>
I also recommend keeping a daily work journal. At the end of every day, write a few bullet points about what you did that day. You can review it with your mentor now and then to keep him/her updated about your progress. It serves as documentation that you’re showing up for work everyday and doing something. You can turn in the work journal at the end of your internship as proof of your work ethic.
</p>
<h2>
Part 2: Software Engineering Process
</h2>
<p>
There isn’t much to discuss for part 2. The principles outlined in part 2 work regardless of whether you’re working remotely or in the office. Just always remember to generate your requirements and plan appropriately. It’s much easier to rewrite a paragraph or edit a box in a drawing than it is to rewrite a hundred lines of code.
</p>
<h2>
Part 3: Company Culture
</h2>
<p>
Company culture can be tricky to navigate in a remote setting because you have fewer opportunities to meet new people. You won’t be able to meet people randomly in the hallway, kitchen, or cafeteria anymore. Most social interactions will be virtual and you’ll want to take advantage of as many of these virtual events as you can in addition to creating more opportunities yourself.
</p>
<p>
Most firms organize virtual social events for the entire company or a particular department. If there is a large enough intern class, there will be sessions in which speakers talk about various aspects of the firm. And there may be virtual lunches and happy hours specifically for interns. Be sure to take full advantage of all the offerings organized by the company or as part of the intern program. You’ll meet more people and experience more of the company culture.
</p>
<p>
Beyond what’s provided by the firm, you can go out of your way to create more opportunities to meet people. If you are the only intern at your company, you should mention to your mentor that it would be great to meet more people and get a sense of the company culture. Your mentor will probably be happy to help you out by virtually introducing you to other people. If there are lots of interns, feel free to organize virtual events such as an intern game night. Then invite your mentor and ask if s/he would like to invite full-time coworkers as well. The ultimate goal is to end up meeting more people and having conversations that shed more light on what’s going on in the company.
</p>
<h2>
Part 4: Having Fun
</h2>
<p>
Like exploring company culture, having fun is trickier now in a remote setting. You can’t just go and meet up physically with other interns anymore. Your fun is limited to virtual interactions, but with a little creativity, you can still end up having a good time. Here are some ideas:
</p>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/">Jackbox Games</a>.</b> Jackbox games are one of my favorite party activities. For $20-$30, you can get a set of five games. One person can share their screen with the game and everyone else only needs to join with their mobile device. Some games require creativity, others require trivia knowledge, and others require artistic skill. There’s something for everyone and it is guaranteed to give you hours of fun and socializing.
</p>
<p>
<b><a href="https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/">Tabletop Simulator</a>.</b> If you’re a fan of traditional board games, you can buy Tabletop Simulator for $20. It lets you simulate a board game night. You can find many fun games like chess, poker, Codenames, or Pandemic on there. And if you get bored of one game, you can easily switch to another.
</p>
<p>
<b>Virtual Houseparty.</b> Invite everyone to join a video chat with their own drinks. If people don’t know how to make cocktails or mocktails, show everyone how to make some drinks at the beginning. Create a shared jukebox online where all the guests can add songs and everyone can listen to the same music at the same time. It’s a best attempt at replicating an in-person houseparty, but make sure anyone else you’re living with will be okay with the potential noise.
</p>
<p>
<b>Virtual Performances.</b> Since the lockdown started, many comedy clubs, theaters, musicians, and other performers have started giving virtual performances. Some of them may even be free. You can gather a group together and take advantage of the variety of online offerings now!
</p>
<p>
<b>Movie Watchparty.</b> Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and other streaming sites have watchparty extensions that let you synchronize content across everyone’s computers. That way, everyone can gather together and watch a movie in sync. It’s even better if you have a video chat open on the side to see each other’s reactions.
</p>
<p>
<b><a href="https://intern.club/">Intern Club</a>.</b> My friend from college started an intern community that now has thousands of members. By joining the community, you’ll get to meet lots of other interns and partake in tons of fun remote events. Intern Club will take away the stress of organizing, so that all you have to do is enjoy yourself. Plus, they’ll have career-focused events as well.
</p>
<p>
Although a lot of activities such as eating at restaurants, drinking at bars, and outdoor group sports are no longer possible, there are still a variety of ways to have fun virtually. Try your best to adapt to the new social distancing limitations and remember that this is only temporary; things will eventually be back to normal.
</p>
<h2>
Don’t Be Afraid of New
</h2>
<p>
Covid19 has forced everyone to adapt to a completely new lockdown situation. Both companies and interns will have to try out new ways of overcoming the obstacles of remote internships. If you’re afraid of trying something new, remember that the nervousness is all in your mind. Set a goal of failing at least once a month: whether it be a conversation with someone that didn’t go well, or organizing an event where nobody showed up. If you fail, then you’ve succeeded as well: you met your monthly goal of failing. And you’ll learn from the experience: you’ll learn that there’s nothing wrong with failing and you’ll come out unscathed. Keep in mind your goals from the past four internship articles, have a plan on achieving those goals, and don’t be afraid of stepping outside your comfort zone. You’ll do great!
