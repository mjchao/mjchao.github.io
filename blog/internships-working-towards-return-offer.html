You passed the resume review, you passed the interviews, you got an offer and accepted it, and now you’re excited to start your summer internship! Internships are a major stepping stone towards an awesome full-time job after college. Navigating an internship can seem intimidating, especially if you’re not sure what to expect. This is the first of a series of posts about internships. In this article, I will explain how internships work at a high level and provide tips on how to get a return offer.
</p>
<h2>
What are the Goals of an Internship?
</h2>
<p>
For companies, internships are an opportunity to test out your skills without the commitments they have to make to full-time employees. When a company makes a full-time hire, they pay for medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and workplace insurance. They pay for vacation, commuter benefits, 401k matching, and the list goes on. A full-time employee can cost 2-3 times their hourly wage when benefits are included, while an intern just costs the hourly wage. And to get rid of a bad hire, the company has to deal with severance pay, potential lawsuits, or just someone who goes on to bad-mouth them. Rather than risking full-time offers to people who may not end up a good fit, companies use internships as a cost-effective way to test out talent. They can hire, or even overhire, people for internships, promote the best performers to full-time, and pass on underperformers with no strings attached.
</p>
<p>
For you, the intern, there are three main goals of an internship:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>To get a return offer</li>
	<li>To find a place you want to work</li>
	<li>To have fun and enjoy your freedom from school</li>
</ol>
<p>
This post discusses the first point: how to work towards the return offer. In subsequent posts, we’ll discuss the remaining goals and also provide a special segment on navigating remote internships.
</p>
<h2>
Working Towards the Return Offer
</h2>
<p>
Your number one priority should be working to get your return offer. Having one return offer, whether for another internship next summer or for full-time, is always better than having zero offers. To understand how to get a return offer, we should consider the perspective of the person with the biggest say on whether or not you get a return offer: your technical mentor.
</p>
<p>
On the first day of your internship, you will meet your technical mentor and s/he will tell you about the technical project(s) you have been assigned to complete by the end of your internship. Throughout the course of the internship, you will run into coding problems that may require input from someone with more experience than you. Your technical mentor will be your guide through those issues. At the end of the internship, your technical mentor will be asked, “would you want to work with your intern full-time?” Your mentor’s answer likely factors in the following aspects:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your technical ability</li>
	<li>Your personality</li>
	<li>Your work ethic</li>
</ul>
<p>
Throughout the internship, you want to ensure you’ve made a positive impression in all three areas so that your mentor’s answer is a resounding, “Yes, I would love to have my intern work here full time!” Here are tips for addressing each of the three areas.
</p>
<h3>
Technical Ability
</h3>
<p>
Technical ability is judged on if you successfully complete your project. Does your code compile? Does your code run correctly? Is your code efficient? Did you follow standard software engineering principles? If your mentor ends up being able to use the code you have written without much additional effort, you can consider the technical aspect of your internship a success!
</p>
<p>
Most of your technical ability comes from your coursework and learning in college. Pay attention in lecture, do your homework, finish your personal and class projects, and work hard during the school year. You’ll find yourself technically prepared for any typical software engineering internship.
</p>
<h3>
Personality
</h3>
<p>
Personality is judged on if other people enjoy being around you and working with you. Most people aren’t the charming kind of person who brings a smile to everyone’s face the moment s/he steps into the room. If you can do that, then props to you - you will go very far in any environment that involves working with others. Otherwise, I recommend simply doing what you’re told to do, avoiding conflict, and getting through the internship without any red flags.
</p>
<p>
The most common personality problem in the software engineering domain is probably being confrontational. Sometimes, someone on your team will tell you to revise your code and a natural instinct is to argue. The majority of the time, your mentor with years more experience than you is correct, and you should just do what s/he tells you to do. Don’t argue, and if you still have the urge to disagree, phrase your resistance in the form of questions: “My way achieves XYZ, but how does yours?” instead of “No, I refuse because my way achieves XYZ and yours doesn’t.” Your mentor determines if you get a return offer, so avoid creating tension with him/her.
</p>
<h3>
Work Ethic
</h3>
<p>
Work ethic is judged on how hard you appear to work and like personality, this attribute is highly subjective. First and foremost, you should be well-versed in basic office etiquette:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Respond to emails within 24 hours</li>
	<li>Reply to instant messages as soon as you are out of a meeting</li>
	<li>Be available to pick up the phone when someone gives you a call, scheduled or not</li>
	<li>Arrive on time for meetings</li>
	<li>Rehearse for presentations</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are unfamiliar with these general rules, you can Google “basic office etiquette” and there will be a plethora of sites with more information. As an intern (and even as a full-time employee) you want to give the impression that you can be a mature employee.
</p>
<p>
In addition to office etiquette, one of the best ways to give off a “hard worker” impression is by staying longer in the office. A common problem is when an intern doesn’t appear to be working eight hours a day. People will say, “as long as you get your work done, you’re fine,” but you can’t tell if they’re speaking the truth or just being politically correct. Unless you’re a unique, irreplaceable superstar, it’s better to err on the side of caution by putting in at least your eight hours a day. In the morning, be at your desk before your mentor arrives. In the evening, leave after your mentor leaves. You don’t have to be working on your project - if you’re blocked or finished your project early, you can self-study something. As long as you appear to be working, others will naturally assume you are dedicated to your work.
</p>
<h2>
How do Intern Mentors Evaluate?
</h2>
<p>
Most intern mentors focus their evaluation on technical ability - it’s still mostly a meritocracy (I hope) in tech. Do a good job on your project and you’ll probably get a return offer. However, a problematic personality or work ethic will almost certainly make you lose your return offer; software engineering is a collaborative discipline and annoying everyone around you or being a slacker is a sure way to not get hired. And if you didn’t do too well on your project, an outstanding personality or work ethic could work in your favor and help make up for your technical shortcomings.
</p>
<p>
In summary,
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Technical ability gets you the full-time offer. Make sure you pay attention in school and complete enough projects; otherwise, your internship is doomed from the beginning.</li>
	<li>Personality is a way to “hang” yourself. Be sure to keep your personality in check and avoid conflicts, whether or not you’re at fault, because that will raise a red flag to your mentor.</li>
	<li>Work ethic is another way to “hang” yourself. Make sure you follow proper office etiquette and give off the impression that you’re working long hours.</li>
</ol>
