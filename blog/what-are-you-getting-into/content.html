Computer science is steadily growing in popularity these days. It is the most attractive major - according to my biases and probably statistical evidence as well. If you’re planning to declare computer science as your major, have you considered what you’re getting into? This post outlines three positive and three negative attributes with which I would characterize the computer science major and the most common parts of the computer science field. Remember that it’s my opinion though and I am not necessarily correct.
</p>
<h2>
Thrilling
</h2>
<p>
I’ll start off with one of the best qualities: thrilling. When I started programming, I loved getting the computer to do things that I once had difficulty doing, like plotting math functions. To me, being able to instantly draw a function was like magic. In the computer science major, you gain the foundations to perform such magic.
</p>
<p>
These days, you can never really be sure what magic is coming out tomorrow. Cryptocurrencies are gaining more relevance in day-to-day transactions. Google has produced self-driving cars and I’m already hearing about self-flying-car startups. Maybe one day I’ll never be sick again when nanobots kill all germs and viruses in my body? Computers will continue enabling humans to do things that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. Yesterday’s magic is becoming tomorrow’s reality and you’ll be a part of that! To me, that’s an extremely thrilling experience.
</p>
<h2>
Applicable Everywhere
</h2>
<p>
Computer science is applicable everywhere, so no matter what your interests are, you can apply computers to them. Are you a fan of football? These days, computers can analyze plays and improve a team’s performance. Do you like painting? Computers can draw their own pixelated images, and perhaps one day, robots will hold brushes too. Are you interested in curing harmful diseases? Puzzled biologists once released a protein folding game in which gamers helped the researchers model an AIDS-related enzyme. Even your mailman’s route was probably optimized by a computer to take as many right turns as possible! Computer science applies to nearly everything, so it’s a great major, regardless of what kind of impact you want to make in your life. 
</p>
<h2>
Profitable
</h2>
<p>
“Profitable” is an obvious trait. Everyone wishes they bought certain stocks like MSFT when they first came out. These days, if you work for the next hottest startup, you can get some stocks and cash out when the company IPOs! Or, if you join a large, established software company, you’ll easily make twice the median household income in the United States. In addition, there’s more demand than supply for programmers and even less supply for experienced programmers who can design software systems well. When you complete a computer science major and take a job after graduation, two or three years of your salary will easily exceed what you invested for four years of college tuition. Profitability is a huge driving factor for the current influx of computer science students.
</p>
<h2>
Unforgiving
</h2>
<p>
Here’s the first negative attribute: computers are unforgiving and do exactly what you tell them to do. You’ll probably have to work with an autograder sometime during your studies. If your code passes all test cases, you’ll get a 100% and if your code fails all test cases, you’ll get a 0%. Maybe in English class you always got at least a D on your essays because it was hard to justify an F, but in computer science class, if you really did a bad job, you will get a 0% from the autograder regardless of how much time you spent. After all, there’s no leniency in the real world: for example, a floating-point imprecision once caused a missile to kill friendly soldiers. Computers can be like a stuck-up child, resisting you by taking your every command as literally as possible. Combine that with trying to pass an autograder and you end up with a lot of frustration - thankfully no military snafus will result from college projects though.
</p>
<h2>
Demanding
</h2>
<p>
Computer science is a detail-oriented major and getting all the work done involves fixing every little thing. A missing comma no longer gets skipped over by your professor - instead, the compiler screams at you. You have to test and validate your own code and try to get 100% coverage - otherwise, the autograder will just “happen” to find ten things wrong with your work and dock thirty points from your score. When you move to harder concepts like multithreading, attention to detail becomes even more important as it gets harder to trace errors in the code. Computer science really demands a lot of your focus and mental energy because the processes are systematic and small mistakes can easily grow into big screwups that take forever to fix. 
</p>
<h2>
Intimidating
</h2>
<p>
The enormity of computer science departments these days makes it hard to accommodate everyone and make everyone feel at home. When you have more peers, you’ll meet people whose achievements far outshine yours. You’ll also have a ton of struggling peers who swamp office hours so that you have to wait hours to get help too. Furthermore, despite the growth of the computer science major, it’s not exactly diverse and implicit bias makes some feel unwelcome. And of course, whenever there are a lot of students, there are always the arrogant ones who act as if they conquered the world during their sophomore year of college. Computer science programs are becoming enormous and this leads to a variety of issues that can make you question whether you chose the right major.
</p>
<h2>
Is the Computer Science Major For You?
</h2>
<p>
When choosing a college major, you want to make sure that it’s worth your time and money. There’s a joke about a family sitting down for graduation lunch and the waiter says, “Congratulations! What was your major?” The kid says, “X” (where X is not restaurant management) and the waiter responds, “Awesome, me too!” If you pay for and attend college, you want to make sure you’ll use the skills you picked up. As mentioned earlier, computer science is applicable to almost every discipline, and you’ll always be able to find work that applies your hard-earned skills. Computer science is absolutely useful and I’d recommend everyone give it some consideration.
</p>
<h2>
Are you Going to do Well in the Computer Science Major?
</h2>
<p>
In my experience, the people who do well in the computer science major are motivated and are comfortable with quantitative thinking (as opposed to qualitative thinking). Motivation is required to do anything well - not just computer science - so that’s a given. Let’s look at quantitative thinking next.
</p>
<p>
In the computer science major, it helps if you think well in terms of hard numbers. Consider the task of determining why your program isn’t fast enough to pass an autograder. You would solve this by timing different parts of your code, finding the part takes the most time, and then timing parts of that part, and so on until you reach the root cause. There is no creativity involved and little room for error - if you time something incorrectly, you’ll hit a red herring and have to start over. If you can follow strict procedures all the way through and allow yourself to be driven by the quantitative outputs you observe, you’ll do very well in the major. Creativity and qualitative thinking help drive the concepts and ideas, but in classes, it’s the quantitative work that ultimately gets you your grades.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this doesn’t mean if you don’t like numbers then you’ll fail. Science hasn’t pinpointed anything that’s indicative of how good a computer science student you’ll be, but if you enjoy thinking quantitatively, I believe you will likely do well.
</p>

Next Steps
</h2>
<p>
Now that you know what you’re getting into, do you think you’re a good fit for it? If yes, keep up the good work! If you’re having doubts, you could consider switching to a major that you like. Still, I honestly wouldn’t blame you if you declared computer science for the salary at the end of the tunnel. These days, everyone is searching for a job that has high impact, is fun, and pays well. For those who claim anyone can get all three, I’d argue that’s way too idealistic. If you simply hit the “pays well” criterion, I think you’re already doing much better than normal expectations. So give computer science some thought! If you choose to pursue it, all the blog posts here are geared to help you perform well in college and in the computer science major.
