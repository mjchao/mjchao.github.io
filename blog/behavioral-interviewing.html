        <p>
Behavioral interviewing consists of open-ended questions focused on the qualitative aspects of your life rather than about getting the right answer. A simple behavioral question could be “tell me about yourself.” A tougher question could be “what is one thing you disliked about your previous job?” Your goal is to provide fresh, creative answers to behavioral questions without raising any red flags.
</p>
<p>
You will get asked behavioral questions at all stages of your career. If you have very little programming experience, such as when you apply for a freshman research position, you could get a full behavioral interview. Later in your career, you might get behavioral questions interspersed with technical questions. A problematic answer to a behavioral question could get your application rejected even if you did well on the technical parts. Behavioral interviews matter at all stages of your career so it is very important to prepare your responses.
</p>
<h2>
Preparation
</h2>
<p>
An effective way to prepare for behavioral interview questions is to practice answering them beforehand. Interviews are essentially tests and if you’ve done practice tests already, the real exam shouldn’t come as a surprise. First, you should come up with some behavioral questions that you might get asked and type out coherent responses. In this stage, you can always delete things that shouldn’t have been said and insert things you forgot to mention. These writeups contain the bulk of the experiences you end up sharing in the actual interview.
</p>
<p>
Next, you can imagine an interviewer asking you a question and try your best to respond. The first time you do this, you’ll probably forget what to say, but the more you practice, the more comfortable it’ll get. Continue practicing until it feels natural. You can also ask a friend if you sound genuine. You’re basically rehearsing for a show in which you convince your interviewer that you’re a great person to hire.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this blog post will discuss how to come up with behavioral interview questions for the “practice test” and then how to answer those questions.
</p>
<h2>
What Kinds of Questions Will I Get?
</h2>
<p>
Here are a few examples of standard behavioral interview questions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why do you want to work for us?</li>
  <li>What makes you qualified for this position?</li>
  <li>Tell me about an obstacle you had to overcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your answers to these questions should highlight your strengths and avoid your weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
You should also be ready to answer uncomfortable questions they may have about your work or education history:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why did you get a C in this class?</li>
  <li>What did you dislike about your last/current job?</li>
  <li>What did you do during the one-year gap on your resume?</li>
  <li>What is your greatest weakness?</li>
</ul>
<p>
You need to answer these questions tactfully so that the interviewer is satisfied and you haven’t raised any red flags.
</p>
<p>
Common behavioral interview questions can be found online - just Google “behavioral interview questions.” It should be relatively quick to come up with a long list of these. If a question you find seems unreasonable to you, feel free to ignore it.
</p>
<h2>
What Makes an Answer Great?
</h2>
<p>
The toughest step is to generate responses to behavioral interview questions. There is no such thing as a “right answer” - only if you impressed the interviewer or not. Two aspects of an impressive answer are positive content and intriguing presentation.
</p>
<h3>
Positive Content
</h3>
<p>
Your content should consist of positive experiences you’ve had that would impress an interviewer. This is when you get to pick out the best parts of your life and talk all about them. You can describe something on your resume in greater detail. Or you can bring up a completely new experience. Many work- and school-related things you’d like to brag about can serve as positive content during your behavioral interview. Non-work and non-academic achievements, such as leadership in an extracurricular organization, can also be relevant because the behavioral interview seeks to explore your personality, as opposed to your technical qualifications. Take some time to come up with a list of accomplishments you’re proud of.
</p>
<h3>
Intriguing Presentation: STAR Method
</h3>
<p>
You should convey your positive content in an interesting manner so that your interviewer doesn’t get bored. A lot of people recommend the STAR method for presenting a response to a behavioral interview question. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result. You start by giving some background on a difficult Situation that needed to be resolved. Then you state your Task and how you fit in. Next, you describe the Actions you took to resolve the situation. Finally, you talk about positive Results.
</p>
<p>
When you talk about the actions and the results, be sure to convey that you made a strong, positive impact on the situation. In the previous blog post on <a href="https://mjchao.github.io/blog/embellishing-your-resume.html">resumes</a>, I brought up the point of embellishing content by skewing subjective adjectives in your favor; you can also apply the same concept here. For example, if an event was a “success,” say it was a “massive success and everyone loved it.” Be careful not to describe yourself with embellishing adjectives though: “I am a massively successful programmer” would sound arrogant. Emphasize how the actions and results illustrate your positive character to impress the interviewer.
</p>
<p>
The STAR method resembles story plot stages that you may have learned about in elementary school: the Situation is the exposition that sets the scene, the Task is the rising action that builds tension, the Action is the climax, and the Result is the resolution. People love to hear a good story and you can impress your interviewer by using the STAR method effectively. For further reading, here is a post dedicated to the STAR method by TheBalance Careers: <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629">How to Use the STAR Interview Response Technique</a>.
</p>
<h3>
Uncomfortable Questions
</h3>
<p>
If you get asked an uncomfortable question such as, “What did you dislike about your previous job?” chances are you can’t rely on a positive experience like in the previous sections. Saying, “my manager was too nice so I left,” isn’t going to convince the interviewer. On the other hand, saying “my manager was a total ******* so I left and I hope you aren’t going to be one,” is going to raise a red flag to the interviewer about your attitude. Uncomfortable questions need to be addressed tactfully.
</p>
<p>
In uncomfortable situations, you want to answer with something unrelated or unessential to the company and role you’re applying to. Regarding the “what did you dislike about your previous job?” question, if you’re applying to a small company, you could say your previous company felt too large. If you’re applying to a bureaucratic firm, you could say your previous company felt too loosely-managed. If you’re applying to an advertising company, saying that you’re a pacifist and didn’t like building missiles at your last job is okay. Keep these answers brief: you don’t have to say anything more about your beliefs and preferences. The last thing you want is to start ranting.
</p>
<p>
If the question is “what is your greatest weakness?” and you’re applying for a role that involves coding all day, you could mention you sometimes have trouble making small-talk. If you’re applying for a client-facing software sales role, you could bring up that you struggle with making local optimizations in code. In these answers, you should mention actions you’ve taken to address the weakness. Don’t forget to rely on the STAR method and tell a story about a time you made progress overcoming the weakness.
</p>
<p>
In all these examples, you avoid setting off any red flags relevant to the company and role to which your applying. Uncomfortable questions usually have one purpose: to give you a chance to shoot yourself in the foot; avoid these touchy situations by talking about something irrelevant to your potential employer.
</p>
<h2>
Curveball Questions
</h2>
<p>
Finally, you should also anticipate “crazy” curveball questions such as “if you were a box of cereal, what kind would you be?” You can usually redirect these kinds of questions to normal ones. For example, you could assume the cereal question relates to what qualities you have. Then the question turns into “what are your best qualities?” You can decide what your best qualities are and then analogize those qualities to a type of cereal in your response.
</p>
<p>
For the cereal example, suppose you are a straightforward, down-to-earth person. You could tell the interviewer, “I’m concise, straightforward and down-to-earth. When I notice any potential dangers that could hurt a project, I don’t hesitate to bring them up immediately. Therefore, I’d think of myself as plain-old Cheerios. No unhealthy added sugars or artificial colors. When you, the project, grow older, you’ll really appreciate all the health benefits from having me around earlier.” Then you could talk about a time your teammates didn’t want to test their code, but you pointed out all the statistics showing that detecting bugs early saves effort later. Don’t forget to consider the STAR method! In this way, you’ve morphed a curveball question into a normal question that is more straightforward to answer.
</p>
<p>
If you can’t find an analogy as smooth as the Cheerios one, you can tell the interviewer you don’t know much about cereal and simply specify the qualities a hypothetical cereal would have: “plain and healthy.” How you answer the question “what are your best qualities?” matters in this situation, but the interviewer won’t care about the type of cereal you pick (unless you’re applying to a cereal company).
</p>
<h2>
Summary
</h2>
<p>
Behavioral interviews are highly subjective. Your goal is to impress the interviewer and avoid setting off any red flags. You can generate a list of questions and practice answering them with the STAR method. You should also anticipate uncomfortable questions and be prepared to answer them tactfully. Finally, be aware of, but don’t be intimidated by, curveball questions. If you’ve rehearsed thoroughly, the interview should go smoothly.
