Attendance is 10%, weekly homework is 10%, weekly web homework is 10%. These seem like trivial components when the two midterms are worth 20% and the final is worth 30%. The homework may not seem worth it when 70% of your grade can be earned in five hours; however, if you’re shooting for an A, doing well in smaller things makes a big difference in the long run.
</p>
<h2>
Example with Excellent Homework and Attendance
</h2>
<p>
Let’s suppose you get 100% on attendance and homework. Furthermore, let’s suppose you do fairly well and get 90% on the two midterms. Then, we solve the equation
</p>
<p>
  <center>
    $(0.3 \times 100) + (0.2 \times 90) + (0.2 \times 90) + 0.3x = 93$
  </center>
</p>
<p>
and we see that to get at least an A (93%) in the class, you just need a 90% on the final. This means that if you have an A- performance on the tests, you can still get an A; the attendance and homework is practically a free boost by a letter grade!
</p>
<h2>
Example With Poor Homework and Attendance
</h2>
<p>
Now, let’s suppose you don’t like going to class and you don’t like “wasting” four hours per week doing homework. From slacking off, let’s say you got an 80% on your attendance and homework. Assume you miraculously averaged 100% on your midterms. Then, we solve the equation
</p>
<p>
  <center>
    $(0.3 \times 80) + (0.2 \times 100) + (0.2 \times 100) + 0.3x = 93$
  </center>
</p>
<p>
To get at least an A (93%) in the class, you need a 97% on the final. You’re going to have an extremely stressful time on the final knowing that if you lose more than 3 points, you lose your A, and if you didn’t get 100% on the midterms, you might not even be able to get an A anymore!
</p>
<h2>
Moral of the Story
</h2>
<p>
The moral of the story is to get 100% in the things that you have full control over. You can’t help when your mind blanks in the last fifteen minutes of the final because of a “surprise” question from the professor. However, you decide whether or not you go to class and you decide whether or not you double-check your homework. So put a lot of effort in perfecting the things you control and you’ll make your life much easier when it comes to taking exams.

</p>
<h2>
Getting Perfect Attendance
</h2>
<p>
There’s no excuse to having perfect attendance. Usually, the professor gives you a few free absences in case of emergencies or job interviews, so use those only when you need them; don’t skip class because you don’t feeling like going, or you’d prefer to lie in bed and watch cute dog videos, or whatever. Furthermore, keep your motivation up with the other lifestyle tips mentioned in this blog. Attending class is not only the easiest part of the grade to get, but it’ll also ensure you stay atop
the difficult material.
</p>
<h2>
Getting Perfect Homework Scores
</h2>
<p>
Assuming you know how to do the homework problems (if you don’t, you won’t score well enough on exams to get an A anyways), the most common cause of low homework scores is silly mistakes. Here are ways to mitigate the number of points you get docked for silly errors.
</p>
<h3>
Make Use of Online Resources
</h3>
<p>
Most of the time, something online can already tell you the answer to your homework question and all you have to do is show your work. Do you have to evaluate a triple integral? WolframAlpha can check that for you too. Do you have to balance a chemical equation? Just Google chemical equation balancer. If your homework consists of textbook exercises, some people post the solution manuals online. If the solution manual is for a different textbook version, the questions will be scrambled and you simply have to match questions across the two editions. In many cases, the problem you need to solve already has the answer available online - just be sure to do your own work first and then validate against an online resource to ensure you didn’t make a silly mistake.
</p>
<h3>
Check With Your Peers
</h3>
<p>
If the answers aren’t easily found online, you can check with your peers. Just get together with some friends in the class and share the final solution to each question. Of course, don’t copy anyone else’s steps and don’t let anyone copy your work. This technique should only be used to make sure you didn’t make a silly mistake, and if your answer doesn’t match others’ answers, you should go back and check your work by yourself.
</p>
<h3>
Double Check Your Work
</h3>
<p>
If the previous two methods don’t work for you, then the last resort is to check all your work from start to finish. This is ineffective, however, because you don’t know where your errors are and you’ll be biased to think your work is correct.
</p>
<h3>
Warnings and Disclaimers
</h3>
<p>
I have heard of all the above methods being used, but have not tried them all myself. Some techniques may get you into academic trouble, so use them at your own discretion. You most certainly should never copy solutions from online resources as you won’t learn the material and you’re just hurting yourself. The techniques here are not a substitute to doing the homework problems. 
</p>
<h3>
The Big Picture on Homework
</h3>
<p>
The big picture here is to avoid silly mistakes and get 100% on the homework assignments. By comparing against external resources, you can locate all your silly mistakes efficiently and fix them.
</p>
<h2>
Summary
</h2>
<p>
Homework, attendance, and other small parts combine to form a significant portion of your final grade. Don’t neglect the small assignments for which you have 100% control over the final score. Apply the techniques discussed in this post to get 100% on those smaller parts. Then you can afford more silly mistakes on the larger exams and the extra leeway makes it much easier to shoot for an A.
