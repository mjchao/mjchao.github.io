Computer science is a very popular major today because there are a lot of benefits to studying it. This post will discuss three of the practical reasons to choose computer science: salary, versatility, and impact.
</p>
<h2>
Salary
</h2>
<p>
The software industry has some of the best paying jobs and software engineers are in high demand these days. When you graduate with a computer science major, the job opportunities and starting salaries will be much higher on average than other majors. For example, at my college, University of Michigan’s College of Engineering, new computer science graduates consistently had the highest median salary compared to all other engineering majors. In 2016, the median salary for bachelor’s graduates was $95,000 (while the median US <i>household</i> income in 2016 was only $60,000!). Excluding computer engineering, which is very similar, the next highest paying engineering major at my college in 2016 was electrical engineering with a median salary of $70,000 for bachelor’s graduates. That’s a difference of $25,000! Studying computer science leads to great jobs that will pay the bills and support the family. Employment is a very practical reason to choose computer science and many people attend college with the primary goal of getting a well-paying, stable job after graduating.

<h2>
Versatility
</h2>
<p>
For some, salary is not as important as doing something enjoyable; computer science is also versatile enough to let you pursue something that intrigues you. Almost every discipline benefits from computers. Here are a few diverse examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physicists run simulations on computers.</li>
  <li>Financial firms use computers to execute trades.</li>
  <li>Medical researchers use artificial intelligence to discover new treatments.</li>
  <li>Historians apply computers to efficiently analyze thousands of historical texts.</li>
  <li>Designers are paid well to create responsive websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even if your primary interest is in another discipline, you can almost always apply computer science to that area. Computer science is an extremely versatile skill to have; after graduating, if you ever decide you really want to get involved in another field, there will be many opportunities to apply computer science in other disciplines.

<h2>
Impact
</h2>
<p>
Finally, if you desire to make a lasting impact on society, computer science can enable that. Computers are revolutionizing the world in countless ways; we’re more connected, more automated, and more innovative than ever before thanks to computers. They’ve made many of society’s recent advancements possible: accessible education is all over the internet, self-driving cars are made possible by sophisticated machine learning, and blockchain has sent a ripple through the currency space. Today, technology-related startups are popping up everywhere and leveraging the power of computers. The world will be waiting to see what ideas you have!
</p>
<h2>
Can I Attain All Three?
</h2>
<p>
Money, enjoyment, and impact are probably the three most desirable qualities of a major. For many people, the dream is to make a lot of money, enjoy life, and have a high impact on the world. Unfortunately, life is not ideal. Many people don’t hit any of the three aspects and attaining all three is even more difficult; however, studying computer science definitely improves your chances. As mentioned earlier, you can almost guarantee a decent salary in a software role, which is a great baseline to have. In addition, assuming there is something you find enjoyable (video games, art, literature, medicine… you name it!), you can almost certainly find software jobs related to it. And finally, if that something you enjoy doing also benefits society, you’ll have hit the third aspect.

Summary
</h2>
<p>
Salary, versatility, and impact are three important attributes of a quality major. A good salary after graduating ensures you’re never struggling to survive day-to-day life. Versatility ensures you can apply your talents to something you enjoy. And impact enables you to make a lasting contribution to society. Computer science hits all three attributes and can be a great major to declare.
