        <p>
Career fairs are large events where companies come to your college to talk to with students. At a typical career fair, you will wait in line at various booths speak with recruiters and hand them your resume. Going to career fairs is a straightforward way to start looking for an internship or full-time job. In this post, I’ll discuss how to make the most of your time at a career fair.
</p>
<h2>
Picking the Companies to Approach
</h2>
<p>
The first step to a productive career fair experience involves preparing before the actual event. You should know which companies are coming to the career fair and which ones you wish to speak with.
</p>
<p>
Before the career fair, the organizers will distribute a list of companies attending the event, where their booths are located, and the majors they are looking to hire. You should read through the list to find the companies that are worth your time to visit. For each company that expressed interest in your major, you can look it up with Google or Wikipedia. Read about their goals, culture, profitability, and other details to determine if you want to visit them at the career fair.
</p>
<p>
Here are some discovery questions to think about when considering a company:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Will working at the company look good on my resume?</li>
  <li>Does the company work on something that interests me?</li>
  <li>Is the company located in a place where I’d like to work?</li>
  <li>Do I have a chance competing against other students who are likely to apply to this company?</li>
</ul>
<p>
An ideal company would have positive responses to all of the above questions, but that’s unlikely to happen. If a company has even one positive response, you should consider talking to them because the initial contact will not require much effort on your part and you aren’t committing to anything by talking to them at the career fair.
</p>
<p>
If a company interests you, you should write down its name. For every day of the career fair, having ten or more companies is a decent amount. Once you have your list, you can sort the companies by how well they did on the discovery questions. Then, look up the location of their booths and be prepared to visit the companies in that order on the day of the career fair.
</p>
<h3>
Word of Caution on Star Companies
</h3>
<p>
While picking companies to visit at a career fair, it’s important not to waste time on “star” companies. Almost everyone wants to work at “star” companies, such as Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Google. The lines for star companies are very long and your resume will have a low probability of being noticed. Also, a star company might have already filled its positions and is simply there to promote its image. To avoid spending a lot of time for very little return, you should rush to visit your
top star company right when the career fair opens because the lines will not have formed. Afterwards, it is more efficient to only visit less-popular booths. For star companies, it will be better to rely on networking and referrals (coming in a future blog post).
</p>
<h2>
Preparing Your Elevator Pitch
</h2>
<p>
In addition to preparing a list of companies to visit, you should prepare what you will say at each of their booths. On the day of the career fair, you will hand your resume to a recruiter or technical employee. They might glance at your resume and ask you specific questions or just wait for you to talk about yourself. If they wait for you to talk about yourself, then you give them your “elevator pitch.”
</p>
<p>
The elevator pitch is a short speech introducing yourself to the recruiter. It can be as simple as telling the recruiter your education background and what kind of position you’re looking for. Then, mention something relevant to the company you’re speaking with to show that you’re invested. Here’s a simple example:
</p>
<blockquote>
My name is John Smith. I am a third-year computer science major looking for an internship. I’m really interested in artificial intelligence. As you can see on my resume, I’ve taken a lot of classes and worked on a lot of projects in artificial intelligence. One of my best projects was a program that could read handwritten C++ code. I was really interested in working at your company because you come up with creative solutions to a lot of challenging data analytics problems.
</blockquote>
<p>
Your elevator pitch is pretty much the same every time except the small snippet at the end that you customize for each company. Memorize it and practice delivering it so that you appear confident to the recruiter during the career fair.
</p>
<h2>
Miscellaneous Reminders Before the Career Fair
</h2>
<p>
Here are a few more housekeeping tasks to do before the career fair:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should have proofread your <a href="https://mjchao.github.io/blog/embellishing-your-resume.html">resume</a>.</li>
  <li>You should print plenty of copies of your resume beforehand.</li>
  <li>You should have purchased appropriate business clothing to wear.</li>
  <li>You should present yourself professionally: comb your hair, brush your teeth, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
During the Career Fair
</h2>
<p>
If you’ve prepared properly, the actual career fair should go smoothly. Go to the vicinity of your top star company’s booth when the career fair starts. If you know that people line up at booths before the career fair starts, then you should arrive even earlier and do the same. After visiting your top star company, visit the remaining companies as you ranked them on your list. It’s also okay to deviate from the list. For example, if you stumble across a cool company you didn’t know was attending, you can definitely visit their booth.
</p>
<h3>
Move On From Bad Experiences
</h3>
<p>
While it’s highly unlikely that anything should go wrong when you’re just introducing yourself, you may have a bad experience once in a while. Occasionally, the company representative didn’t like you and wanted to make you feel bad about yourself. Or you asked a question you shouldn’t have asked. Or any of a million other potential accidents could have happened. Don’t linger on it! Take a quick break to calm down and move on. Each company you approach is independent of the other ones so don’t let one bad experience ruin your confidence and spoil the rest. Besides, nobody keeps a blacklist for the career fair and if you screwed up at one company’s booth, you can still go again next year.
</p>
<h2>
After the Career Fair
</h2>
<p>
Once the career fair is over, any companies that want to interview you will reach out via email in a day or two. With the exception of star companies, if your resume showed you met the job qualifications, you will generally hear back.
</p>
<p>
If you didn’t get any responses, it may be due to poor or incompatible academic credentials. Reasons for not getting interviews include
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your GPA was too low</li>
  <li>You have no past work or project experience</li>
  <li>You are not in the right year of school (e.g. some companies only offer internships to juniors who can convert to full-time the year after)</li>
  <li>Your experiences are not aligned with the technical needs of the company (e.g. you are interested in compilers, but apply for a machine learning role)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For poor academic credentials like a low GPA, you’ll have to work harder or smarter. Feel free to read some of the other blog posts related to academics. If you suspect you had incompatible academic credentials, you are probably picking the wrong companies to approach. When the next career fair comes along, try to account for those incompatibilities in your discovery questions.
</p>
<p>
If you get interview requests, then congratulations! Feel free to read the subsequent posts in this blog that provide tips for interviews and beyond.
