College can be a time consuming and expensive process. It is important to plan ahead and avoid unexpected surprises that could delay your graduation. Overlooking requirements and having to postpone your graduation means paying more tuition, spending more time in classes and missing salary and experiences you could be obtaining in a full-time job. This post describes how to plan out your courses to ensure a smooth undergraduate experience.
</p>
<h2>
Declare Your Major Early
</h2>
<p>
Deciding on your major early and sticking with it can be risky, but it significantly improves your chances of graduating on time. Freshman advisors suggest taking a breadth of introductory classes to figure out what you’d really like to study, but I disagree with their advice. On one hand, you don’t want to be stuck with something you don’t enjoy. On the other hand, you’ll be wasting time taking courses that don’t count towards your final major. In your first or second semester, you may want to look for exploratory courses that do a little bit of every major to maximize your efficiency. If you can figure out what you’d like to do in your freshman year, you’ll have wasted minimal time in unnecessary courses and can immediately start planning out the remaining years of college.
</p>
<p>
(If you are thinking about declaring computer science, this <a href="incentives-for-declaring-cs.html">post</a> provides some practical reasons for declaring computer science even if you still have no idea of what you’d like to study.)
</p>
<h2>
Planning Out Your Courses
</h2>
<p>
As soon as you’ve decided on a major, you should acquire a list of graduation requirements and determine what courses you are going to take and when you will take them to fulfill each requirement. It helps to make a spreadsheet for this. Each column can be one semester and you list the courses you plan on taking each semester. Then, in a separate area, you can copy each of the graduation requirements and write down the course that fulfills the requirement. If there are any missing requirements, then you know immediately and can address them. Here is an example:
</p>

</center>
<p>
You should also validate each course and semester. For each course, check if all the prerequisites were met in previous semesters and if the course was historically offered during that semester (e.g. Fall, Winter, Spring). For each semester, you should also check that the workload is reasonable. You don’t want to stack several super-hard courses all into one semester because if you fail one, that could totally mess up your course plan.
</p>
<p>
It’s also okay if you aren’t confident you want to take your selected courses; the initial course plan is flexible and you can adjust your classes later on. The schedule is just there to show that it is still possible for you to graduate on time by taking some sequence of courses. As you take more classes and your preferences change, you can swap and move planned future courses around. The earlier you adjust your courses, though, the more flexibility you will have to address missing prerequisites for new ones that you’re adding.
</p>
<h2>
Confirm Your Course Plan with an Advisor
</h2>
<p>
Once you’ve built your course plan, you should meet with an advisor frequently to confirm that your plan is valid. The first time you show an advisor your course plan, s/he may point out mistakes. You should address those errors. After you’ve validated a course plan with an advisor, you should meet at the beginning of each semester thereafter. If you make a course change that would cause you to miss a graduation requirement, your advisor can catch that. As long as you check in before the add/drop period ends, you can fix your mistake. If possible, you should also meet with the chief advisor for your major because s/he is the least likely to make a mistake.
</p>
<h2>
Summary
</h2>
<p>
College is a long and expensive endeavour so it’s important to plan out your courses. Having a proper course plan ensures you will be able to graduate on time. You can build an effective course plan by deciding on a major sooner rather than later and building out a course plan to meet all the graduation requirements. As you progress through your degree, you can adjust the course plan based on your preferences. Remember to validate your course plan with an advisor at the beginning of each semester though to catch any mistakes you may have made that prevent you from graduating on time.
