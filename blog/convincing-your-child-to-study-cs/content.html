If you’re like the “helicopter parents” I’ve seen and really want your child to study computer science but s/he refuses to do so, this article might be for you!
</p>
<p>
In this article I will provide some extremely <i>practical</i> for why someone entering college should choose to study CS. Someone with a practical outlook on life (as opposed to idealistic) may be influenced by the suggestions in this article. I can’t guarantee what I have to say will have an effect, but perhaps they’ll be more open to listening to someone close to their age…</p>
<p>
Warning: Studying CS won’t end well if you haven’t taught your child to be responsible. A responsible child who does not like CS but accepts that it is the practical major to pursue will complete all the work and end up fine. An irresponsible child will not do the required work, flunk out, and waste your tuition.

<p>
Now off to the topic of why CS…

Why Do We Go to College?
</h2>
<p>
We go to college to get a specialized skillset for our career after college. Some people go to West Point to become an officer in the military. Some people study finance to try and “strike it rich” at a Wall Street investment bank. Some people pursue a PhD in neuroscience to advance society’s understanding of the human brain. So when deciding what to major in in college, the question we should be asking ourselves is, “What career do I want after college?”
</p>
<p>
No college advisor focuses on “What career does my advisee want after college?” They always say, “study what interests you because it’ll make you happy!” - that’s a trap and most students fall into it. The reality is advisors don’t get a performance bonus if all their advisees get jobs. They’re just salaried people who keep you happy else you become their headache, and as soon as you’re out the door, they dust their hands clean. Your parents are the ones who care about you and are always focusing on the critical question: “What career should my child pursue after college?” That’s what I want to address in this article.
</p>
<h2>
What Career Should I Pursue? ... Which Then Determines “What Should I Major in?”
</h2>
<p>
There are three main dimensions to a career: impact, enjoyment, and profitability. Impact is when your job improves society, enjoyment is if you enjoy your job, and profitability is if your job pays you well.
</p>
<p>
It’s great if you can get all three dimensions satisfied, but that means you have to be really lucky. Can you list people whose careers are strong in all three dimensions? Maybe Bill Gates, Taylor Swift, Oprah Winfrey, and Tom Hanks - but likely few, if any, of your relatives or people in your immediate friend circle. Practically speaking, you’re not going to get all three dimensions right out of college, so you should prioritize.
</p>
<p>
Profitability should come first. You can have a high impact or enjoy your work, but without a secure job that pays well, life will be stressful. If you have overdue bills lurking in the back of your mind and your landlord is about to evict you, then you’re not going to stay at your low-paying job no matter how much you enjoy it or how much an impact it makes on the world. Only when you have a stable, well-paying job do you set up the foundation for your other two dimensions.
</p>
<p>
Big tech has some of the most profitable careers. You can view compensation packages at a number of tech companies here: <a href=https://www.levels.fyi/>Levels.fyi</a>. The big tech firms like Google and Facebook are paying $180,000 total compensation your first year:

<p>
For reference, you can ask your parents what $180,000 (minus income tax) can buy. Jobs in big tech guarantee you meet the profitability dimension in your career - and this doesn’t even consider the amazing free food, the fun work events, the 40-hour workweek, free professional development classes, etc. Finally, the surest way to get a job in big tech is to major in computer science.
</p>
<h2>
Can I beat the Competition for these Tech Jobs?
</h2>
<p>
You may be skeptical and think, “if these jobs pay so well, won’t there be a lot of competition for these jobs and be super hard to get a job offer?” When tech was a smaller industry, it used to be insanely hard to get a job; I bet if I had been born seven years earlier, I would’ve struggled with technical interviews too. But tech is a massive industry now. The number of geniuses graduating from computer science programs doesn’t keep up with tech companies’ demand for employees. Thus, the tech industry is constantly lowering the hiring bar to meet demand. I know a fair number of people working at big tech companies and I’m aware of their abilities. These days, an “average” person can pass the technical interviews and it’s all about getting a referral now.
</p>
<p>
With a referral, you can be the dumbest person in the world and a recruiter will at least glance at your resume; with no referral, you can be the smartest person in the world and a recruiter won’t notice your application among the million other applications in their online portal. If you network properly in college and get to know people older than you who enter big tech firms a year or two before you’re applying, you’ll be able to get all the referrals you need. All a referral entails is someone inside the company enters your name into a system - and they may even get a cash bonus if you’re hired. You just need to put on your thick skin and reach out to a lot of people. The referral is the hard part and afterwards, the process is fairly straightforward if you properly study for your technical interviews.
</p>
<h2>
Tangential topic: What about other Industries?
</h2>
<p>
Other industries might satisfy the profitability dimension, but computer science tends to be the safest option. A lot of other majors lead to industries with fewer job opportunities. What is the probability you’ll get a job and are you willing to stomach the risks? Can you compete for a few job openings against the kid who’s been doing related research since high school? Or the kid whose dad knows all the CEOs in the industry? If you spend 4 years studying a mildly-risky degree and lose to the competition for one of those limited jobs, then you’re stuck with a “useless” diploma and you don’t get those 4 years back. As someone who sees what goes on in the tech industry, I can assure you that short of a nuclear war that wipes California off the map, there will be multiple tech job openings for an average, responsible CS student.
</p>
<h2>
What’s Next?
</h2>
<p>
So maybe you feel like you’re selling out to big tech and that’s a waste of your life; I would suggest you look at it from a positive perspective: you’re satisfying one of the three important career dimensions so that you can expand on the other two later. Some people can’t even get one dimension… I won’t list any examples to avoid being offensive, but I’m sure you can list lots of jobs that don’t pay well, aren’t enjoyable, and have a negative impact on the world. Satisfy one of your career dimensions while you can! Pursuing CS is a very logical and practical decision, and if you read further, you’ll realize that you don’t end up “selling out” and “wasting your life.”
</p>
<p>
Once you set up your foundations with a job that meets the profitability dimension, you can always change jobs and start expanding on the other dimensions. If you really want to make an impact, you could bring your software expertise to the biomedical field to fight cancer. If you really want an enjoyable job, once you’ve saved up a million dollars or so, you can quit and go produce art, or go back to school and study whatever piques your interest. When you study CS, you are not limited to just tech; you can apply CS to other industries, or you can make enough money and then do what you want.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a “generic” story that numerous people who are happy today go through: they grow up as responsible, smart students who study hard. Then they go into a lucrative industry such as investment banking, private equity, or hedge funds. In their 20s, they work 80 hours a week, maybe get yelled at by their boss to the point of crying, and they stick it out. Once they have earned enough money, they quit, get married, start a family, and pursue a more-enjoyable and/or more-impactful job, like teaching or music. The new job sometimes pays a low wage, but they are financially stable due to all the money they have saved from their 20s. Big tech is the newest addition to the list of lucrative industries! Plus, you don’t work 80 hours a week, you don’t get yelled at, and you can end up financially stable to do what you enjoy.
</p>
<p>
One day, I think it’d be fun to teach computer science at a high school like the one I attended. I’ve seen someone quit to go to music school and study clarinet. I’ve seen other people quit to pursue a business idea they always wanted to do. Tons of other people who have studied CS and work in the tech industry have plans for when they are well-off financially. If done right, your story doesn’t end with “I sold out to big tech and have a job I don’t enjoy” - that’s just one stepping stone and there’s much more to come…
</p>
<p>
(And if you enjoy programming like me, there’s nothing wrong with staying in the industry)
