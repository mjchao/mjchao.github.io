          The blog posts here provide tips for success while pursuing the
          popular computer science major. We'll look at ways to perform well in
          classes and receive As. We'll also explore ways to pitch your
          abilities to companies and get valuable internship experiences and
          competitive full-time offers.

					Success in Coursework
				</h2>
				<p>
          College is usually graded on a curve and people are always worrying
          about the average, but what if you just always scored above 93% on an
          absolute scale? During my college years, I rarely had to worry about
          the curve. And when I graduated with my Computer Science Engineering
          degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, I had a
          near-perfect GPA. There are many nuances to learning material and
          performing your best when exams roll around; I'll share those ideas
          in my blog posts.

					Success in the Job Search

				<p>
          You gain a valuable skillset in college, but how do you convince
          companies that's the case? Having experience and confidence helps you
          sell yourself to companies. Doing so eloquently puts you at a
          competitive advantage. I spent three years in undergrad and gained
          valuable experiences from three summer internships (four if you count
          a non-technical one). Currently, I work full-time at a fantastic
          company and can picture myself staying there long-term. In the
          following blog posts, I'll also provide tips on putting yourself in
          the best light when talking to recruiters or interviewing.
