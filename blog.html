      <h1>Tips for Success in the CS Major</h1> 
      <aside class="intro">
        <p>I graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in April,
        2017 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. I
        did pretty well in my major. Looking back, there were a lot of hacks, 
        techniques, and ideas that helped me succeed. Everyone's definition of
        success is different, but mine was getting good grades and internship
        experiences so that I had an excellent full-time job lined up upon
        graduating. I finished my degree in three years with a very high GPA and
        three internship experiences. In the posts here, I'll share some of these 
        tips that might be helpful to you or at least provide an interesting 
        perspective. I hope you enjoy the blog!</p>
