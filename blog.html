      <h1>Tips for Success in the CS Major</h1> 
      <aside class="intro">
        <p>I graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in April,
        2017 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. I
        did pretty well in my major. Looking back, there were a lot of hacks, 
        techniques, and ideas that helped me succeed. Everyone's definition of
        success is different, but mine was getting good grades and internships
        with the ultimate goal of finding an excellent full-time job after
        graduating. I finished my degree in three years with a very high GPA and
        three internship experiences. Now, I work full-time at a fantastic
        company that I don't want to ever leave. In the posts here, I'll share
        some tips that might be helpful to someone pursing a computer science
        major. I hope you enjoy the blog!</p>
