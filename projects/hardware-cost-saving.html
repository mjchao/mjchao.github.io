My team used a specialized piece of hardware for low latency order entry. The hardware was expensive to produce and had a large datacenter footprint. In this project, I was tasked with extending multiple components in the firmâ€™s trading infrastructure to save hardware costs and reduce datacenter load.
</p>

<p>
One decade-old assumption throughout all codebases in the company was that one order entry instance would be used by exactly one trading team to submit orders to exactly one exchange. If a trading team wanted to place orders on X different exchanges, they had to obtain X pieces of the expensive hardware (or more than X for multiple order entry instances on an exchange). This caused trading teams to pay significant amounts of money to maintain their competitive low-latency advantage and led to a headache for the datacenter operations team. I was tasked with making all the necessary changes so that one order entry instance, and thus one piece of hardware, could submit orders to multiple exchanges.
</p>

<p>
Over the course of six months, I produced a proof of concept in which one order entry instance could place orders on four exchanges owned by two different entities with matching engines in the same colocation. I implemented and tested all the code changes in the latency critical path for order submission and advised our UI, risk, back-office automation, and simulation teams on how to accommodate the multi-exchange order entry instances. Finally, I coordinated with trade desk and clearing to ensure that the entire infrastructure properly handled the orders and trades generated by the improved order entry system.
</p>

<p>
We successfully upgraded trading teams to the improved order entry system and avoided hundreds of thousands of dollars in hardware costs on the four particular exchanges I worked with. Furthermore, the same concept could be applied to any set of exchanges sharing a colocation, paving the way for millions of dollars in future savings.
