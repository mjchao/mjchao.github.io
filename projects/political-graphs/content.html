            <p>You've probably been tempted to copy someone's work while you
            were back in school, but you were deterred by the threat of
            plagiarism checkers! If you go back a few hundred years before the
            existence of computers and automated plagiarism checkers, how
            likely do you think it was that authors stole ideas from each other?
            Apparently there were a lot of dishonorable people!</p>
            <p>For this project at ProQuest, I created a machine learning
            pipeline to analyze hundreds of thousands of works of literature
            over several centuries and flag pairs of documents that contained
            similar passages. Furthermore, the pipeline identified the exact
            phrases that were too-similar.</p>
            <p>Some challenges that I addressed included
              <ol>
                <li>Having billions of pairs of documents that need to be
                  checked</li>
                <li>Accounting for paraphrases and variations of English
                  ("tis ain't symple!")</li>
                <li>Showing copied narrative structure in cases of major
                  plagiarism</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>This was a pretty successful project, but the results are
            not free for the public :p. As a vague example, when I read the
            Wikipedia page praising an author for his brilliant works of
            literature, all I could say was "No duh. He just renamed all the
            characters from another reknowned author's work." These discoveries
            are expected to be useful for researchers at universities across the
            country.</p>
