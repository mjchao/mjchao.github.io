Today, you probably wouldn’t think of copying someone else’s work and trying to sell it. Someone on the internet is going to notice and tell everyone; you’ll get caught and sued. But if you go back a few hundred years before news traveled so quickly and before efficient court systems, how likely do you think it was that authors stole ideas from each other? Apparently there were a lot of dishonorable people!
</p>
<p>
For this project at ProQuest, I created a machine learning pipeline to analyze hundreds of thousands of works of literature over several centuries and flag pairs of documents that contained similar passages. Furthermore, the pipeline identified the exact phrases that were too similar.
</p>
<p>
Some challenges that I addressed included
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Having billions of pairs of documents that needed to be checked</li>
  <li>Accounting for paraphrases and variations of English (“this isn’t simple” versus “tis not symple”)</li>
  <li>Showing copied narrative structure in cases of major plagiarism</li>
</ul>
<p>
This was a successful project, but the results are not free for the public. As a vague example, when I read a website praising a less-well-known author for a brilliant work of literature, I could say “No duh. The ideas are the same and s/he just renamed characters from another renowned author’s work.” These discoveries are expected to be useful for researchers at universities across the country.
