            <p>In algorithmic trading, a gateway is an important piece of
              software that submits orders to exchanges and keeps track of
              the status of all its orders. Errors in the gateway could be
              catastrophic. For example, losing track of a big order means you
              could lose a lot of money when the market moves and you don't
              realize you need to clear your position. One of my internship
              projects at Jump Trading involved designing and implementing a
              regression testing framework for a specific gateway.</p>
            <p>I created a simple language with a few commands for performing
              operations such as buying/selling and assertions. It also
              included features for more-complicated tests, such as killing
              the gateway process and asserting that it restored its orders
              upon restart. Finally, a test driver would find and run every
              test. The framework was also quite extenible and new commands
              could be easily added independent of the other commands.</p>
