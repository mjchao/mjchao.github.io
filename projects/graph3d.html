A calculator is a pretty standard project when youâ€™re short on ideas. Back in my high school days, I created a variety of calculators, from algebraic manipulators to this 3D graphing calculator. The software plotted functions f(x, y) and parametrics (x(t), y(t), z(t)).
</p>
<p>
I started the project a few months after Java 8 was first released to try out the new 3D image rendering. Basically, surfaces and lines were groups of small rectangles bunched together. This was a logical extension from 2D graphing were curves are groups of small line segments bunched together. In the 3D graph, you can move forward/backward and turn left/right with the WASD keys, rotate counter-clockwise and clockwise with QE and shift up/down with the up/down arrow keys. Moving around lets you observe the graph from multiple perspectives.
</p>
<p>
The project code is available on 
<a href="https://github.com/mjchao/3D-Graphing-Calculator" target="_blank">Github</a>
and there is an executable jar file available. However, I never included rigorous error checking, so you will need to use it with care. For example, if your x_inc is negative, the program will never stop graphing. And if your increment is too small, the program will take a very long time. But if all the inputs are valid and your computer has enough memory and computational power, the graphing will succeed.
