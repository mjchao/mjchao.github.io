                    <p>Suppose you hold liberal views and you vote for a representative
            with liberal views and she conveniently gets elected. You are happy
            that she votes on the bills you also support. You conclude that your
            representative is all-so-noble and works for you because you voted
            for her. The system works! ... Well can we definitely conclude that?
            </p>
            <p>Statistically speaking, all you can say is that your
            representative's political beliefs are highly-correlated to your
            district majority's beliefs. This is always the case, because the
            winner always has the majority of the votes. But you don't have
            proof, other than her word, that the way she acts in Congress is
            actually <i>caused</i> by the fact that she wanted your support. It
            could just be coincidence that your views and her secret agenda
            align.</p>
            <p>In this project, my group presented another variable that is
            highly-correlated to a legislator's political beliefs. We trained a
            neural network to help identify the political affiliation of a
            legislator based on his/her corporate donors. We separated
            Democrats from Republicans in various session of Congress  with an
            entropy score ranging from 0.2 to 0.35 (which is very accurate).
            Most of the mistakes were semi-liberal Republicans and
            semi-conservative Democrats. We were surprised to conclude
            that corporate donations are also highly correlated to legislators'
            political affiliations (and also their importance in Congress!).
            </p>
            <p>Now you know that company donations are also just as good
            an indicator of political affiliation as your vote. So do you still
            have absolute faith in our system? Are you absolutely sure your
            representative works for your vote? Just stirring the mud here...
            don't take it too far. Our code was not that polished as we were
            trying to meet a class deadline but we have written up results in a
            very rough paper
