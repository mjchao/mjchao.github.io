Suppose you hold liberal views and you vote for a representative with liberal views and she conveniently gets elected. You are happy that she votes on the bills you support and conclude that your representative works for you to make you happy. The system works! ... Well can we definitely conclude that?
</p>
<p>
Statistically speaking, all you can say is that your representative’s political actions are correlated with your district majority’s beliefs. You can’t assert that the way she acts in Congress is caused by the fact that she wants to please voters; it could just be coincidence that her secret agenda conveniently makes you a happy voter. And many times, we see legislators supporting things that their voters don’t.

<p>
In this course project, my group presented another variable that is highly-correlated to a legislator’s political stance. We trained a neural network to identify the political affiliation of a legislator based on his/her corporate donors. The neural network separated Democrats from Republicans in various sessions of Congress with an entropy score ranging from 0.2 to 0.35 (which is pretty accurate). The mistakes were semi-liberal Republicans and semi-conservative Democrats. This showed that corporate donations can be highly indicative of legislators’ political affiliations. In another visualization of the neural network outputs, we discovered the network had learned about legislators’ voting power and importance in Congress from the donation data.
</p>
<p>
Now you know company donations are just as good an indicator of a legislator’s political affiliation as the people who voted for him/her. So do you still have absolute faith in our system? Are you absolutely sure your representative works for your vote and not for corporate money? Just stirring the mud here... don’t take it too far. I’m sure there are plenty of valid counterarguments. Our code was not that polished as we were trying to meet a class deadline but we have written up results in a very rough paper
