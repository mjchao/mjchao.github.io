In algorithmic trading, a gateway is an important piece of software that submits orders to exchanges and keeps track of the status of all its orders. Errors in the gateway could be catastrophic. For example, losing track of a big order means you could lose a lot of money when the market moves and you canâ€™t clear your position. One of my internship projects at Jump Trading involved designing and implementing a regression testing framework for a specific gateway.

<p>
I created a simple language with a few commands for performing operations such as buying/selling and assertions. It also included features for more-complicated tests, such as killing the gateway process and asserting that it restored its orders upon restart. Finally, a test driver would find and run every test. The framework was also quite extensible and new commands could be easily added independently of the other commands.
