                    <p>My team in my mobile apps and entrepreneurship class was required
              to come up with an app and business idea. We looked around at
              problems we faced day-to-day and determined that some people had
              extra food and some people were very lazy about cooking. We chose
              to build a platform to facilitate food sharing (truthfully, it's
              not a great business idea given all the legal issues involved,
              but we had to do something!).</p>
            <p>I built the backend server that provided a RESTful API to which
              buy and sell offers could be submitted and viewed. It interfaced
              with the Facebook API for login and acquiring information about
              users. I also developed the unit tests for to ensure that the
              backend was robust.</p>
            <p>You can view my team's project on
              <a href="https://github.com/chernamy/food4friends"
                target="_blank">Github</a>
              but we probably will not be continuing any further with the
              project because the legal issues are simply too immense. Although
              the idea was not practical given the legal aspects, the business
              model and coding was solid and I did well in the class.</p>
