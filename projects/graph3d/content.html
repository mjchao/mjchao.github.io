            <p>A calculator is a pretty standard project when you're short on
              ideas. Back in my high school days, I created a variety of
              calculators, from algebraic manipulators to this 3D graphing
              calculator. The software graphed plotted functions f(x, y) and
              parametrics (x(t), y(t), z(t)).</p>
            <p>I started the project a few months after Java 8 was first
              released to try out the new 3D image rendering. Basically,
              surfaces and lines were groups of small rectangles bunched
              together. This was a logical extension from 2D graphing were
              curves are groups of small line segments bunched together. In
              the 3D graph, you can move forward/backward and turn left/right
              with the WASD keys, rotate counter-clockwise and clockwise with
              QE and shift up/down with the up/down arrow keys. Moving around
              lets you observe the graph from multiple perspectives.</p>
            <p>The project code is available on
              <a href="https://github.com/mjchao/3D-Graphing-Calculator"
                target="_blank">Github</a>
              and there is an executable jar file available. However, I never
              included rigorous error checking, so you will need to use it with
              care. For example, if your x_inc is negative, the program will
              never stop graphing. And if your increment is too small, the
              program will take a very long time. But if all the inputs are
              valid and your computer has enough memory and computational
              power, the graphing will succeed.</p>
