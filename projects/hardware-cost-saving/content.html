My team used a specialized piece of hardware for low latency order entry. The hardware was expensive to produce and had a large datacenter footprint. In this project, I was tasked with extending multiple components in the firmâ€™s trading infrastructure to save hardware costs and reduce datacenter load.

One decade-old assumption throughout all codebases in the company was that one order entry instance would be used by exactly one trading team to submit orders to exactly one exchange. If a trading team wanted to place orders on X different exchanges, they had to obtain X pieces of the expensive hardware (or more than X for multiple order entry instances on an exchange). This caused trading teams to pay significant amounts of money to maintain their competitive low-latency advantage and led to a headache for the datacenter operations team. I was tasked with making all the necessary changes so that one order entry instance, and thus one piece of hardware, could submit orders to multiple exchanges.

Over the course of six months, I produced a proof of concept in which one order entry instance could place orders on four exchanges owned by two different entities with matching engines in the same colocation. I implemented and tested all the code changes in the latency critical path for order submission and advised our UI, risk, back-office automation, and simulation teams on how to accommodate the multi-exchange order entry instances. Finally, I coordinated with trade desk and clearing to ensure that the entire infrastructure properly handled the orders and trades generated by the improved order entry system.

We successfully upgraded trading teams to the improved order entry system and avoided hundreds of thousands of dollars in hardware costs. Furthermore, the same concept could be applied to any set of exchanges sharing a colocation, paving the way for millions of dollars in future savings.
