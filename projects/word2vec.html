                    <p>If we want a computer to recommend products for a customer to buy
            given his/her query, the computer needs to understand the
            similarities between words. That way, it can match descriptions of
            products to the customer's query.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, when you give words to a computer, it doesn't
            really have a great way of determining how similar they are. Words
            on a computer are just a bunch of characters and the individual
            characters don't tell much about the meaning of the word. But we
            can try representing words with something that better expresses
            similarity: vectors.</p>
            <p>For this project, my goal was to represent words in Google's
            product data with vectors to express similarity with words
            that might also be in customer queries. We assume that similar words
            are used in similar contexts. Then, the general idea is to learn
            a set of vectors to represent words and a neural network to
            take a word's vector representation and predict its likely context
            words. For example, in the phrase "the cat sat," we'd
            want the network to predict "the" and "sat" when given the word
            vector for "cat". The training data consisted of billions of
            (target, context) pairs of words built from a database of product
            data.</p>
            <p>After these word vectors were learned, we could see, for example,
            that words like "king" and "queen" were closely related to
            "mattress". These vectors were then used as pre-trained data for a
            sophisticated pipeline that combined features of paragraphs and
            images in product data to recommend to shoppers.</p>
