Financial markets have changed significantly in the past couple decades. Several of the positive improvements have been driven by the advent of HFT. In this article, we’ll discuss the benefits that HFT brings to you, the ordinary investor.
</p>

<h2>
Lower Spreads
</h2>

<p>
Let’s start with a common misconception: that every penny HFT earns is a penny they stole from the other side of the trade, which is usually an ordinary investor. In reality, the money that HFT earns from an ordinary investor is more of a service fee, or “spread.”
</p>

<p>
Suppose the true price of MSFT right now is $180.005. When an ordinary investor wants to buy MSFT, they don’t submit a limit order at $180.00 (an order that says, “I will buy 1 share of MSFT at $180.00 or less). With a limit order at $180.00, you might not get your stock at all. You have to wait for someone else to be willing to sell MSFT to you at a loss of $0.005. And if the price of MSFT ends up increasing to $181.00, your limit order becomes outdated and might never trade. So instead, the ordinary investor just submits a market order (an order that says, “I will buy 1 share of MSFT at the best available price) and get filled at $180.01 immediately. Usually, an HFT firm sells to you at $180.01 so the HFT firm earns $180.01 - $180.005 = $0.005 from you.
</p>

<p>
The $0.005 should be viewed as a service fee. The ordinary investor wants his/her stock immediately and wants to be guaranteed a share of the stock. In a capitalist society, nobody will guarantee you such convenience without payment. In this case, the payment is $0.005. Such a service fee makes sense because the HFT firms are risking their money by offering this service for the entire duration of the trading day.
</p>

<p>
The difference between the best bid and best ask in the market is known as the “spread” and the spread is an indicator of the service fee and should never be zero. From the perspective of a market maker who always makes themselves available to buy or sell a stock, one should ask, “what if someone buys MSFT from a market maker and then the price of MSFT goes up?” Then the market maker would lose money. The market maker has to be compensated for taking the risk of being ready to buy or sell a stock at your whim, especially if you might have more information about the future price of the stock than the market maker. This compensation is the spread, and since there is always risk in the markets, the spread should always be nonzero in a fair world.
</p>

<p>
Back in the day when there was less competition from HFT, a big bank or other non-algorithmic market maker might be willing to make a huge spread of $2: for example, offer to buy MSFT from you at $179 and sell MSFT to you for $181 when the true price of MSFT is $180. Ignoring any commissions you pay to your broker, the “service fee” is $1 if you want to be guaranteed a share of MSFT. The big banks didn’t write fast algorithms, or any algorithms at all, to perform market making effectively. What if they sold MSFT to you at $181 and then the price went up to $182 in the markets in the next hour? Then they’d lose a dollar and need appropriate compensation for market making with such risks. Without fast algorithms, the bank requires a large service fee to offset the risk that it takes the wrong side of the trade and can’t get out of its situation in time to avoid an expensive loss.
</p>

<p>
When HFT came around, it introduced more-competitive market making. A faster HFT market-making algorithm no longer needs $2 of spread to offset the risks. HFT algorithms don’t care what the price will be in the next hour, they only care what the price will be in the next second or shorter. In the next second or shorter, the price usually only moves a few pennies. So HFT is able to offer spreads of just a few pennies. Once HFT automated market making and took a short-term time horizon, the ordinary investor only had to pay a service fee of a few pennies to get the stock they wanted. HFT firms do not “steal” pennies from the ordinary investor; as pointed out earlier, this “service fee” must always exist in a fair world and HFT firms provide low service fees to help investors save.
</p>

<p>
Think of market makers as grocery stores. When you go to the grocery store, you pay more for an apple than if you bought directly from the farmer. So why don’t people drive fifty miles out to the farm to save money? It’s not worth the hassle and maybe the farmer doesn’t even have apples to sell when you get there. It’s much more convenient to go to the grocery store. Now replace “apple” with “stock” and “farmer” with “stock exchange” and you can see that HFTs have opened the super-low-margin stores that make stocks extremely affordable at just a few cents more than trying to trade with the source yourself.
</p>

<h2>
Zero Commission Trades
</h2>

<p>
One of the revolutionary apps of the 2010 decade was the Robinhood app and its zero commission trades; what you might not know is that zero commission trades on Robinhood were made possible by HFT. Have you ever wondered how Robinhood makes revenue if not from commissions? Robinhood makes money because certain HFT firms pay Robinhood for its order flow: that is, Robinhood is paid millions of dollars each year for sending its orders to certain HFT firms. The HFT firm can then choose whether to trade against the order or pass and let it go to the public markets.
</p>

<p>
From the Robinhood user’s point of view, there is only upside in this. US federal regulations require the HFT firm to provide a price at least as good as what’s visible on the public markets. If the HFT firm trades against the Robinhood order flow, the execution price for the Robinhood user will be at least as good as what the public markets display, so the Robinhood user doesn’t lose from having his/her order flow sold.
</p>

<p>
(One caveat is that public markets may have invisible orders that nobody can see and these orders could be better than the best visible price. Payment for order flow does take away that upside, but ordinary investors don’t seek out invisible orders anyways. Furthermore, even if routed to the public markets, an order still may fail to execute at the best invisible price because the exchange with the best invisible price isn’t considered until it also has the best visible price.)
</p>

<p>
Why would HFT firms pay millions of dollars for order flow then? The answer is that the orders of ordinary investors are profitable to trade against on a short-term time horizon. When an ordinary investor buys stock, s/he considers what the price will be in the next day, week, month, or longer, but doesn’t consider what the price will be in the next second. So in the next second, the investor’s decision will be profitable around 50% of the time since s/he is effectively guessing at random. The HFT firm, however, is specialized in the short-term time horizon. If an HFT firm has, say, a 60% chance of predicting the correct price movement in the next second, then the HFT firm can profit off the ordinary investor’s guess that’s only right 50% of the time. Since everyone on Robinhood is an ordinary investor not caring about the price of their stock in the next second, the Robinhood order flow is extremely profitable for HFT and it costs millions to purchase Robinhood order flow.
</p>

<p>
You might say, “wait a minute, the HFT firm is stealing from Robinhood investors then…” but that’s not true because the ordinary investor never cared about making a suboptimal trade in the next second. The ordinary investor cares about getting a 10% return on their trade over the next few days or months. In addition, the ordinary investor’s order would’ve gotten “picked off” in the public markets anyways. The ordinary investor’s order has the same outcome regardless of whether their order flow was bought, but at least with payment for order flow, ordinary investors receive the benefit of zero commissions.
</p>

<p>
Ordinary investors’ orders, also known as retail flow, have an interesting property: orders are placed without consideration to the price in the short-term horizon (i.e. the next second). Before HFT firms, the ordinary investor’s disregard for the short-term horizon was useless “trash” to everyone. But when HFT firms came around and specialized in the short-term horizon, they started to pay for retail flow and ordinary investors consequently benefited from reduced and zero commissions. HFT firms essentially turned the ordinary investor’s “trash” into “treasure.”
</p>

<h2>
Stability in the Markets
</h2>

<p>
Finally, HFT helps in stabilizing prices on markets. If a trader wants to cause the price of a product to change, s/he has to trade through all the bids or asks at a price level. HFT market making algorithms add both buy and sell orders, a.k.a. “liquidity,” to the markets. If a trader wants to buy up the price of a stock, the liquidity from HFT algorithms force the trader to trade through a lot more orders and take on a larger, riskier position to move the price. If the price of the stock decreases, the trader can lose a ton of money; thus the extra liquidity disincentivizes people from arbitrarily moving the price of a product and brings more stability.
</p>

<p>
HFT also helps nerf panic buying and selling. When a shocking economic event happens like the 2009 mortgage crisis, a war, or Covid19, irrational investors start panic buying and selling. When panic buying and selling ensues, prices stop being rational and correlated products start to get out of sync. HFT firms specialize in the short-term horizon and do an excellent job with their price prediction algorithms and soften prices changes that become abnormal. Earlier, in <a href="/hft/intro-to-hft-1-how-it-works.html">Intro to HFT, Part 1</a>, I provided an example of this behavior with the E-Mini S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures contracts. If the S&amp;P 500 futures contract becomes extremely expensive and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract becomes extremely cheap relative to each other, then something likely is wrong because both indices share a lot of the same stocks. An HFT algorithm might sell down the price of the S&amp;P 500 futures contract and buy up the price of the Nasdaq 100 futures contract to earn a profit. When market prices get out of whack, HFT firms take the profitable side of the trades and push prices back into reasonable territory.
</p>

<h2>
A Note on the Flash Crash
</h2>

<p>
There is no definitive explanation of what caused the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_flash_crash">flash crash</a>: some blame HFT algorithms, the SEC blamed an unusually large order placed by an investment firm, and a different trader was also arrested for illegal spoofing activity that supposedly caused the crash. My perspective is the flash crash happened because multiple toxic, non-HFT actors injected extreme instability to the markets. There were too many large sell orders by multiple “toxic actors” throughout the day, not just the one that the SEC singled out, that cleared out all the demand from non-HFT players who actually wanted to hold a position in the contract. In either scenario, toxic actors completely met all demand to buy the contract, similar to someone dumping a billion barrels of oil onto the markets. But worse than oil, the S&amp;P 500 futures contract price is correlated to countless stocks and other financial instruments, so the bloodbath spread everywhere else. This was an unexpected corner case in the markets, and what happened next with HFT algorithms was, in my opinion, reasonable and possibly beneficial.
</p>

<p>
HFT market-making algorithms do not add any real supply or demand to the market because they do not intend to hold a position; they simply provide a price-stabilizing service. Thus, HFT algorithms must operate under the assumption that they can always sell excess contracts at some price, which is a reasonable assumption. When toxic actors completely wiped out all real demand, then there was only supply left. In a corner case with plenty of supply and zero demand, the price of the contract was effectively zero and market making algorithms actually helped slow the price decline to zero while hoping for buyers to reenter the market. The only bids left in the market belonged to HFT algorithms and the excess shares that HFT algorithms wanted to offload got passed from one HFT algorithm to another at steadily decreasing prices, thus leading to the “flash crash.” In the words of the SEC, the shares were passed around like a “hot potato” between HFT firms - until a few minutes later when non-HFT players reentered the markets, took advantage of the low prices (low for a long-term time horizon), added more demand for the contract, and bought the HFT algorithms’ excess shares. My interpretation is that yes, HFT firms played a role in the flash crash because you should not market-make in a system with no other buyers. However, the “hot potato” trading was helping slow an otherwise instant price change to 0 and at the worst, it was simply a symptom of poor operating methodology in the US financial market: it should never be possible for a group of institutions to sell so much of a contract that they effectively eliminate all buy-side demand.
</p>

<p>
The flash crash resulted from problems with how the US financial markets operated, and not from HFT algorithms. There was nothing to prevent a group of toxic actors from flooding the market with sell orders, wiping out demand, and causing a flash crash. Afterwards, stock exchanges added circuit breakers: if the price of a product drops too much, then trading halts for a few minutes. If the price still continues dropping, then trading might halt for the rest of the day. Circuit breakers fix the problem by making it impossible for toxic actors to clear out all the bids and inject a massive amount of instability; circuit breakers also give time for all the non-HFT players to replenish demand when a toxic actor does attempt to clear out all the bids.
</p>

<h2>
Summary
</h2>

<p>
In most financial markets, ordinary investors take a long-term, low-frequency time horizon and HFT firms take a short-term, high-frequency time horizon. The combination of the two time horizons leads to synergy where both sides of the trade can win: the HFT algorithm can be profitable in the next second, and the ordinary investor can be profitable* over the next day, week, month, or longer. When HFT added short-term expertise to the markets, the long-term, ordinary investors profited in the form of lower spreads, zero commissions, price stability, and additional benefits beyond what is covered in this article.
</p>

<p>
* Now, if you, an ordinary investor, do lose money on your trade, it’s not HFT that “stole” your money; an HFT market maker simply provided a connection for you to trade against another long-term investor who took the opposite side of the trade and “stole” your money.
