High Frequency Trading, or HFT, is not a well-publicized industry. Most HFT firms are small and don’t feel a need to go out of their way and explain the industry to the entire world. You may have heard a few snippets here and there, but by and far, I see a lot of misunderstanding in the content out there.

As a recent college graduate myself, finishing up my third year in the HFT industry, I’ve seen quite some interest in HFT from peers outside the industry. What’s HFT about...? They wonder. Deep learning sorcery with neural networks hundreds of layers deep? A mess of buggy and fragile software that could accidentally wipe out stock markets in an instant? Front-running and a worldwide conspiracy involving governments and stock exchanges trying to defraud investors? I think the best way to clear up misconceptions and the sinister fog around HFT is to explain in simple terms how the industry works; once there is a simple explanation, the speculative thought experiments naturally disappear.

This goal of this blog is to introduce HFT to a general audience and then provide advice to technical people who may be interested in careers in the HFT industry. We’ll start with some articles explaining how HFT works and its history. Then we’ll cover some of the software engineering aspects, and if you’re a computer science student or software engineer curious about job opportunities in HFT, we’ll discuss what skills are in-demand and how to prepare for interviews.

If the audience for this grows, we’ll add in some interviews or guest articles by hardware engineers for the electrical and computer engineers out there, and content by quantitative researchers for the math, physics, statistics, and other quantitative professionals out there.
