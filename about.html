        <p>Years ago, I was focused on making complicated software. I used to
        brag about my first large project. I completed it during my tenth grade
        summer vacation. The application was a collaborative whiteboard with
        audio and text chat. Ten thousand lines of code, a hundred classes! You
        can even view it on my Github if you'd like:
          <a href="https://github.com/mjchao/Interactive-Whiteboard" 
            target="_blank">Interactive Whiteboard</a>.
        It's not a very interesting project though. You probably can't even run
        it to see what it looks like. You were warned - it's a very complicated
        piece of software and not even I know how to run it anymore.</p>

        <p>Luckily, I've since pivoted my business model to making cleaner
        software instead of complicated software. One of my last publicly
        viewable projects is the backend server I wrote during a senior year
        course. The server provides a RESTful API for a food sharing app.
        You can set it up in 2 commands and authenticating your MySQL
        database. The program runs with a simple "python app.py" command. You
        can also run a complete regression test with a simple "make test"
        command. Now half a year later, I can probably read the code and still
        explain it to you. This product is much simpler and cleaner than my
        Interactive Whiteboard.
        </p>

        <p>I am most proud of the consideration I give to my software's
        customers. If you're an end user, you're my customer. I want to create
        software that covers up the complicated parts and provides an interface
        that's easy to use. If you're my coworker/manager, you're my customer.
        I want to create software that's simple to understand. If you're the
        person replacing me on the project (obviously because I got moved to a
        more important project :p ), you're my customer. I want to create
        software that's maintainable and extentible. Using this smart process to
        create smart software is what I view as intelligent software
        engineering.</p>

        <p>On a side note, I also focused on artificial intelligence for my
        undergraduate studies. You can read more about the other kind of
        intelligent software I've created under
        <a href="#" target="_blank">Projects</a>.
