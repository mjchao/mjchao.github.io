      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <aside>
<p>
I started programming in 2008 and since then, I have written an enormous amount of code and gained practical experience from numerous projects. Currently, I work in the algorithmic trading industry and contribute to low-latency software that executes orders on approximately one hundred exchanges.
</p>

<p>
My biggest focus is on the software development process. I emphasize requirements and design to reduce the amount of time wasted on writing code that ends up being rewritten. I generate timelines and estimates to maintain visibility on progress. I write plenty of documentation so that everyone can get a high-level understanding of my projects. And I create examples and tutorials so that anyone else can start using or contributing to my projects. The extra effort pays off in the long run when people are able to collaborate efficiently in a massive codebase.
</p>

<p>
Today, I work primarily with C++ code for algorithmic trading software. Iâ€™ve written, profiled, and optimized C++ code involving threads, processes, shared memory, and hardware and network interaction. These concepts allow me to squeeze out microseconds and nanoseconds of latency; the faster software enables my company to beat competitors to the profitable trades in the market. Beyond these low-level optimizations, I am well-versed in data structures and algorithms from my USA Computing Olympiad participation in high school, and I have a solid understanding of artificial intelligence from the projects and internships I undertook during college.
</p>

<p>
Outside of work, I play squash in the winter and run outside when the weather gets warm. I play a lot of classical piano and occasionally write short stories when an idea pops up in my mind.
