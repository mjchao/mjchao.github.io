        <h1>The High Frequency Trading Industry</h1> 
        <p>
High Frequency Trading, or HFT, is not a well-publicized industry. Most HFT firms are small and donâ€™t feel a need to go out of their way and explain the industry to the entire world. You may have heard a few snippets here and there, but by and far, I see a lot of misunderstanding in the content out there. This goal of this blog is to introduce HFT to a general audience and then provide advice to technical people who may be interested in careers in the HFT industry.
